The problem involves transforming a given string `s` into an accordion by removing some characters. An accordion is a string that can be represented as a concatenation of an opening bracket, a colon, some vertical line characters, another colon, and a closing bracket. The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from `s`, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through the string `s` and push characters onto a stack. We will use the following rules to push characters onto the stack:

- When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we push it onto the stack.
- When we encounter a colon `:`, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening bracket `[`. If so, we push the colon onto the stack.
- When we encounter a vertical line `|`, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is a colon `:`. If so, we push the vertical line onto the stack.
- When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is a colon `:`. If so, we push the closing bracket onto the stack.

We will also keep track of the minimum and maximum possible length of the accordion. The minimum possible length is 2 (the opening and closing brackets) and the maximum possible length is the number of characters in the string.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

- If the string `s` is empty, the maximum possible length of the accordion is 0.
- If the string `s` does not contain any opening or closing brackets, the maximum possible length of the accordion is -1.
- If the string `s` contains multiple opening or closing brackets, the maximum possible length of the accordion is -1.

The problem requires finding a positive integer that does not exceed a given integer `x` and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are multiple such integers, we need to find the largest one.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can design the following algorithm:

1.  Convert the given integer `x` to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
2.  Initialize an empty string `max_num` to store the integer with the maximum sum of digits.
3.  Initialize a variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum of digits.
4.  Iterate over all possible numbers from `x` down to 1.
5.  For each number, convert it to a string and calculate the sum of its digits.
6.  If the sum of digits is greater than `max_sum` or if the sum of digits is equal to `max_sum` but the current number is greater than the number stored in `max_num`, update `max_sum` and `max_num`.
7.  After iterating over all numbers, print the number stored in `max_num`.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the given integer `x` is a single-digit number, the number itself is the maximum sum of digits.
*   If the given integer `x` has a sum of digits equal to 1 (e.g., 9), the maximum sum of digits is achieved by decrementing the digit by 1 (e.g., 8).
*   If the given integer `x` is a large number with many digits, the algorithm may take a long time to run. However, since we are only considering numbers up to `x`, we can optimize the algorithm by iterating over numbers in descending order.

The problem involves finding the next lucky year in the Berland calendar, where a lucky year is defined as a year with no more than 1 non-zero digit. The task requires writing a program that takes the current year as input and outputs the number of years until the next lucky year.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach by checking each year from the current year onwards to see if it's a lucky year. We can use a simple loop to iterate through each year and check the condition of having no more than 1 non-zero digit.

Here's a step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter to store the number of years until the next lucky year.
2. Iterate through each year from the current year onwards.
3. For each year, check if it's a lucky year by converting it to a string and counting the number of non-zero digits.
4. If the year is lucky, increment the counter and break the loop.
5. If the year is not lucky, increment the counter and continue to the next year.
6. Return the counter value as the number of years until the next lucky year.

### Edge Cases

Some edge cases to consider are:

* If the current year is already a lucky year, the output should be 0.
* If the current year is 1, the output should be 4 (since the next lucky year is 5).
* If the current year is a large number with many non-zero digits, the program should still be able to find the next lucky year.

This problem is a variant of the classic ""Interval Scheduling Problem"" or ""Activity Selection Problem"" in computer science. The goal is to select a subset of painters (activities) that maximizes the number of sections painted.

The constraints are:

* Each section can be painted by at most one painter.
* A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.
* We can hire at most $q-2$ painters.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming.

1. **Preprocessing**: For each painter, calculate the number of sections they will paint. This can be done by subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound and adding 1.
2. **Sort Painters**: Sort the painters based on the number of sections they will paint in descending order.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of sections painted using the first `i` painters and `j` painters. Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and `dp[0][1] = 0`.
4. **Fill dp Table**: Iterate over the painters and for each painter, iterate over the possible number of painters (1 to `q-2`). For each cell `dp[i][j]`, calculate the maximum number of sections painted by considering two options:
	* Exclude the current painter: `dp[i-1][j]`
	* Include the current painter: `dp[i-1][j-1] + sections_painted_by_current_painter`
5. **Return Result**: The maximum number of sections painted is stored in `dp[n][q-2]`.

**Edge Cases**

* If `n` or `q` is 1, there is only one possible solution, and it's the painter that paints the only section.
* If `n` is greater than or equal to `q-2`, the maximum number of sections painted is equal to `n`.

The problem is asking us to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to wake up at a specific time. The time is considered lucky if it contains the digit '7'. We are given the interval of time between the alarm and the wake-up time, and the wake-up time. We need to find the smallest multiple of this interval that results in a lucky time.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach. We can generate all possible times in the interval between the alarm and the wake-up time, and check if each time is lucky. If we find a lucky time, we can return the number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button. If we don't find a lucky time, we can return -1.

1. Generate all possible times in the interval between the alarm and the wake-up time.
2. For each time, check if it is lucky by checking if it contains the digit '7'.
3. If we find a lucky time, return the number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button.
4. If we don't find a lucky time, return -1.

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the interval is 0, the alarm and the wake-up time are the same, so Jamie needs to press the snooze button 0 times.
* If the wake-up time is 00:00, we need to handle this case separately because there are no minutes to check.

This problem can be categorized as a dynamic programming problem. We need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened.

The problem involves two types of operations: moving the cursor to the left or right, and closing all the tabs to the left or right of the cursor. We need to consider the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, denoted by a and b respectively.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of seconds needed to close all the tabs outside the segment [i, j] when the cursor is at the tab i.

We can then fill up the table using the following recurrence relation:

- If i = j, dp[i][j] = 0 (no operation needed)
- If i < j, dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i][k - 1] + dp[k + 1][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j]) where k is the index of the tab that Luba can move to
- If i > j, dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][k - 1] + dp[i + 1][k], dp[i - 1][k] + dp[i][k]) where k is the index of the tab that Luba can move to

We can then use the table dp to find the minimum number of seconds needed to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].

**Edge Cases**

- If l = r = 1, we only need to close all the tabs to the left of the cursor, so the minimum number of seconds is 0.

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to always choose the blow that cuts off the maximum number of heads, while ensuring that the monster does not grow new heads.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Sort the blows in descending order of their cutting power (`d_i`).
2. Initialize the current number of heads (`curX`) to the initial number of heads of Zmei Gorynich.
3. Initialize the number of blows to 0.
4. While the monster has at least one head:
    * Choose the blow with the maximum cutting power (`d_i`) that does not make the monster grow new heads.
    * Cut off the maximum number of heads using the chosen blow.

5. If the monster is defeated (i.e., `curX` is 0), return the number of blows. Otherwise, return -1.

The barn can become full and spill over any extra grains, which are not taken into account.

The problem is a graph theory problem where we have a matrix (storehouse) of sofas, each with a set of neighboring sofas. The task is to find the sofa that matches the given conditions (number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom).

**Algorithm Design**

The algorithm can be designed in the following steps:

1.  **Read Input**: Read the number of sofas, the size of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa, and the given conditions.
2.  **Build Graph**: Build a graph where each sofa is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if the corresponding sofas share a side.
3.  **Count Neighbors**: For each sofa, count the number of neighboring sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom.
4.  **Check Conditions**: Check if the given conditions match the count of neighbors for each sofa.
5.  **Find Matching Sofa**: Find the sofa that matches all the given conditions.

**Edge Cases**

*   **Empty Storehouse**: If the storehouse is empty (no sofas), return -1.

The problem involves finding the minimum and maximum possible number of days off in a Martian year, which has a variable number of days (n) but a fixed 5-work-days-and-2-days-off weekly pattern.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can consider the following approach:

1.  Calculate the minimum possible number of days off by dividing the total number of days in a Martian year (n) by 7 (the number of days in a week). This will give us the number of complete weeks and any remaining days.
2.  Since each week has 2 days off, the minimum number of days off will be the number of complete weeks multiplied by 2, plus the number of remaining days. However, if the remaining days are more than 5, we need to add 2 more days off (since 5 days can be work days and the remaining 2 can be days off).
3.  Calculate the maximum possible number of days off by considering the worst-case scenario, where the remaining days are all work days. In this case, the maximum number of days off will be the number of complete weeks multiplied by 2.

**Edge Cases**

*   If the number of days in a Martian year (n) is 1, the minimum and maximum number of days off will be 0, since there are no complete weeks.
*   If the number of days in a Martian year (n) is a multiple of 7 (e.g., 14, 21, 28), the minimum and maximum number of days off will be equal, since all the days can be divided into complete weeks with 2 days off each.

This problem involves finding the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles in a specific pattern. The pattern depends on the divisibility of tile indices by two numbers, a and b, and the number of chocolates received for painting each tile red or blue.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with mathematical reasoning. Here's the high-level idea:

1. Calculate the number of tiles that will be painted red, blue, or both.
2. For each type of tile (red, blue, or both), calculate the maximum number of chocolates that can be received.
3. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to handle tiles that are painted both red and blue.

The key insight is to recognize that we can paint tiles in any order, so we should choose the order that maximizes the number of chocolates.

**Algorithm Steps**

1. Initialize variables to store the number of red, blue, and both tiles.
2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to calculate the number of tiles that are painted both red and blue.
3. Calculate the maximum number of chocolates that can be received for each type of tile (red, blue, or both).
4. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to handle tiles that are painted both red and blue.
5. Return the maximum total number of chocolates that can be received.

**Edge Cases**

* If a and b are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then there will be no tiles painted both red and blue.
* If a and b are not coprime, then there will be tiles painted both red and blue, and we need to use the CRT to calculate their number.

The problem is a classic example of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) problem. We have a set of courses, and each course has a set of prerequisites that must be completed before taking the course. The goal is to find the minimum number of courses that need to be taken to complete all the main courses.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use a topological sorting algorithm. Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a DAG such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

1.  Create an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each key is a course and its value is a list of its prerequisites.
2.  Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to detect any cycles in the graph. If a cycle is found, it means there's no way to complete all the main courses, so return -1.
3.  Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited courses.
4.  Initialize a result list to store the sorted courses.
5.  Perform a topological sort using DFS. For each course, if it's not visited, perform a DFS from that course. During the DFS, add the course to the result list and mark it as visited.
6.  After the DFS, the result list will contain the minimum number of courses that need to be taken to complete all the main courses.

### Edge Cases

The problem is asking us to find a permutation `p` of size `n` such that the first `k` elements of `p` are equal to the given array, and the remaining `n-k` elements are chosen to make `p` stack-sortable. A permutation is stack-sortable if it can be rearranged by repeatedly removing the top element from the stack and appending it to the end of the array, such that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Algorithm Design:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the remaining `n-k` elements of `p` such that it is stack-sortable. We can use the following approach:

1. Sort the first `k` elements of `p` in descending order.
2. Initialize an empty stack `s`.
3. Iterate through the sorted `k` elements and push each element onto the stack `s`.
4. Iterate through the remaining `n-k` elements of `p` from 1 to `n`. For each element `i`, if `i` is greater than the top element of `s`, pop the top element from `s` and append it to the end of `p`. Then, push `i` onto the stack `s`. Otherwise, push `i` onto the stack `s` without popping any element.
5. If the final permutation `p` is stack-sortable, return it. Otherwise, return `-1`.

**Edge Cases:**

* If `k = n`, then the input array is already a permutation and there is no need to modify it.
* If `k = 1`, then the input array contains only one element, and the remaining `n-1` elements of `p` can be chosen to make `p` stack-sortable by simply appending them in increasing order.
* If `k = 0`, then the input array is empty and we need to fill it with `n` elements to make `p` stack-sortable. In this case, we can choose the remaining `n` elements to be from 1 to `n` in increasing order.

To solve this problem, we need to find the remaining `n-k` elements of `p` such that it is stack-sortable. We can use the following approach:

1. Sort the first `k` elements of `p` in descending order.
2. Initialize an empty stack `s`.
3. Iterate through the sorted `k` elements and push each element onto the stack `s`.
4. Iterate through the remaining `n-k` elements of `p` from 1 to `n`. For each element `i`, if `i` is greater than the top element of `s`, pop the top element from `s` and append it to the end of `p`. Then, push `i` onto the stack `s`. Otherwise, push `i` onto the stack `s` without popping any element.
5. If the final permutation `p` is stack-sortable, return it. Otherwise, return `-1`.

**Edge Cases:**

* If `k = n`, then the input array is already a permutation and there is no need to modify it.
* If `k = 1`, then the input array contains only one element, and the remaining `n-1` elements of `p` can be chosen to make `p` stack-sortable by simply appending them in increasing order.
* If `k = 0`, then the input array is empty and we need to fill it with `n` elements to make `p` stack-sortable. In this case, we can choose the remaining `n` elements to be from 1 to `n` in increasing order.

The problem describes a sequence `s` where the first element is `a` and each subsequent element is obtained by adding `c` to the previous element. We need to determine if a given integer `b` appears in this sequence.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize the sequence with the first element `a`.
2. Iterate through the sequence, adding `c` to the current element to obtain the next element.
3. Check if the current element is equal to `b`.
4. If `b` is found in the sequence, print ""YES"" and terminate.
5. If the sequence grows indefinitely (i.e., `c > 0`) and `b` is not found within a reasonable number of iterations, print ""NO"".

The problem involves determining whether it's possible to create a regular bracket sequence by arranging a given set of bracket sequences of length 2 in a specific order. A regular bracket sequence is one that can be obtained by inserting characters ""+"" and ""1"" into a bracket sequence.

**Key Insights**

1.  A regular bracket sequence can be obtained by inserting characters ""+"" and ""1"" into a bracket sequence.
2.  The given bracket sequences of length 2 are of four types: ""(("", ""()"", "")("", and ""))"".
3.  To create a regular bracket sequence, we need to balance the number of ""("" and "")"" characters.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can analyze the balance of ""("" and "")"" characters in the given bracket sequences. We will use a variable `balance` to keep track of the balance of ""("" and "")"" characters.

Here are the steps of the algorithm:

1.  Initialize the `balance` variable to 0.
2.  Read the counts of each type of bracket sequence.
3.  For each type of bracket sequence, update the `balance` variable based on the type of sequence:
    *   For ""(("", increment `balance` by 1.
    *   For ""()"", do nothing, as it doesn't affect the balance.
    *   For "")("", decrement `balance` by 1.
    *   For ""))"", increment `balance` by 2.
4.  If the final `balance` is not 0, it's not possible to create a regular bracket sequence, so return 0.

The problem describes a scenario where spectators in a stadium start and stop standing in a wave pattern. We are given the number of spectators `n`, the wave duration `k`, and the current time `t`. We need to determine how many spectators are standing at time `t`.

The wave pattern involves spectators standing and sitting in a cyclical manner, with `k` spectators standing and then the previous `k` spectators sitting. We can observe that the number of standing spectators changes every `k` time units, and the number of spectators standing at time `t` is determined by the remainder of `t` divided by `k`.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the remainder of `t` divided by `k`, which represents the position in the wave cycle.
2. Use this position to determine the number of spectators standing at time `t`. We can do this by calculating the minimum between `t` and `k` (since the wave cycle repeats every `k` time units), and then using this minimum value to index into an array of standing spectators.

Here's a high-level outline of the algorithm:

* Calculate `r = t % k` (remainder of `t` divided by `k`)
* If `r < k`, the number of standing spectators is `r`
* Otherwise, the number of standing spectators is `k`

**Edge Cases**

* `t = 0`: No spectators are standing.
* `t = k`: All `k` spectators are standing.
* `t = n + k - 1`: The last `k` spectators are standing.

The problem is asking to transform two strings `s` and `t` into empty strings, and string `u` into lexicographically minimal. The game has two possible moves: extract the first character of `s` and append it to `t`, or extract the last character of `t` and append it to `u`. The goal is to make `u` lexicographically minimal.

**Algorithm Design:**

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to store the characters of `t` and `u`. We will iterate over the string `s` from left to right. For each character, we will append it to `t` if it is less than or equal to the top of the stack (to keep `u` lexicographically minimal). If it is greater than the top of the stack, we will pop the top of the stack and append it to `u`.

**Edge Cases:**

*   If `s` is an empty string, the output should be an empty string.

This problem is a simple validation problem where we need to check if the given level stats are correct or not. The stats are given in chronological order, and we need to check if there could exist a sequence of plays and clears that matches the given stats.

The main constraints of the problem are:

* The number of plays and clears at each moment of time are non-negative integers.
* The stats are given in chronological order.
* The number of plays increases by 1 at each moment of time.
* If the player finishes the level successfully, the number of clears increases by 1 at the same moment of time.

This problem is a permutation problem with constraints. Given two positive integer numbers `a` and `b`, we need to permute the digits of `a` to construct a maximal number that does not exceed `b`. The resulting number must not have a leading zero.

### Algorithm Design

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1.  Convert both `a` and `b` to lists of digits.
2.  Sort the digits of `a` in descending order.
3.  Iterate through the digits of `b` from left to right.
4.  For each digit in `b`, try to find the largest possible digit from the sorted digits of `a` that is not greater than the current digit in `b`.
5.  If no such digit exists, append the smallest digit from the sorted digits of `a` to the result.
6.  After iterating through all digits in `b`, append any remaining digits from the sorted digits of `a` to the result.
7.  Join the resulting digits together to form the final answer.

### Edge Cases

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If `a` is equal to `b`, the result is simply `a`.
*   If `a` is less than `b`, the result is `a`.
*   If `a` and `b` have different lengths, the problem is not well-defined.

The problem is a 5-in-a-row game where Alice and Bob take turns placing either crosses (X) or noughts (O) on a 10x10 grid. The goal is to determine if Alice can win in one turn by placing a cross in an empty cell.

To win, Alice needs to create a line of at least 5 crosses horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The input is a 10x10 grid represented as a matrix of characters, where 'X' represents a cross, 'O' represents a nought, and '.' represents an empty cell.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by simulating each possible move of Alice and checking if she can win in one turn. Here's a step-by-step algorithm:

1.  **Read the grid**: Read the 10x10 grid from the input.
2.  **Count empty cells**: Count the number of empty cells in the grid.
3.  **Simulate each possible move**: For each empty cell in the grid, simulate Alice's move by placing a cross in that cell.
4.  **Check for win**: Check if Alice can win in one turn by placing a cross in that cell. This involves checking all possible lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) of length 5 or more.
5.  **Repeat steps 3 and 4**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all empty cells in the grid.
6.  **Output result**: If Alice can win in one turn by placing a cross in any empty cell, output ""YES"". Otherwise, output ""NO"".

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   **No empty cells**: If there are no empty cells in the grid, it's impossible for Alice to win in one turn.
*   **All cells occupied**: If all cells in the grid are occupied, it's impossible for Alice to win in one turn.

The problem requires us to create a symmetrical matrix with a given size and a specified number of ones, such that the resulting matrix is lexicographically maximal. The matrix should have n rows and n columns, and the ones should be placed in a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will start by placing the ones on the main diagonal of the matrix, as this will give us the maximum possible lexicographical order. Then, we will place the remaining ones in the upper triangular part of the matrix, starting from the top-right corner and moving down to the bottom-right corner.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the matrix with zeros.
2. Place the ones on the main diagonal of the matrix.
3. Calculate the number of ones that need to be placed in the upper triangular part of the matrix.
4. Place the remaining ones in the upper triangular part of the matrix, starting from the top-right corner and moving down to the bottom-right corner.
5. If the resulting matrix has a lexicographical order greater than the current maximum, update the maximum matrix.

This problem is a variation of the ""Longest Proper Prefix Which Is Also a Suffix"" (LPS) algorithm. The main idea is to find the minimum number of operations required to type a given string by either typing characters one by one or copying the string and appending it to itself.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. The key insight is to consider the following:

- If we copy the string and append it to itself, we can type the first `i` characters in `2 * i` operations.
- If we do not copy the string, we can type the first `i` characters in `i` operations.

We can then use the following recurrence relation:

`dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1, 2 * i)`

However, this is not the final recurrence relation. We also need to consider the case when we copy the string and append it to itself. In this case, the last character is repeated. Therefore, the correct recurrence relation is:

`dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[i//2] + 1 + (i % 2))`

This recurrence relation considers both the cases when we copy the string and append it to itself, and when we do not copy the string.

**Edge Cases**

The following are some edge cases to consider:

- If the string is empty, the minimum number of operations is 0.
- If the string has only one character, the minimum number of operations is 1.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of digits to replace in a 6-digit ticket to make it ""lucky."" A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of its first three digits equals the sum of its last three digits. The ticket can start with the digit 0.

We can approach this problem by calculating the difference in sums between the first three and last three digits. If the difference is 0, the ticket is already lucky, and no replacements are needed. Otherwise, we need to find the minimum number of replacements to make the difference 0.

### Algorithm Design

1. Calculate the sum of the first three digits and the sum of the last three digits.
2. If the difference between the sums is 0, the ticket is already lucky, and the answer is 0.
3. Otherwise, initialize the answer to 0 and iterate through each digit in the ticket.
4. For each digit, increment the answer by 1 if replacing the digit would make the difference between the sums 0.
5. Return the answer.

1. An empty string: This case is not possible since the input is a 6-digit string.
2. A string with less than 6 digits: This case is not possible since the input is a 6-digit string.

    #","### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the minimum number of digits to replace in a 6-digit ticket to make it ""lucky."" A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of its first three digits equals the sum of its last three digits. The ticket can start with the digit 0.

We can approach this problem by calculating the difference in sums between the first three and last three digits. If the difference is 0, the ticket is already lucky, and no replacements are needed. Otherwise, we need to find the minimum number of replacements to make the difference 0.

### Algorithm Design

1. Calculate the sum of the first three digits and the sum of the last three digits.
2. If the difference between the sums is 0, the ticket is already lucky, and the answer is 0.
3. Otherwise, initialize the answer to 0 and iterate through each digit in the ticket.
4. For each digit, increment the answer by 1 if replacing the digit would make the difference between the sums 0.
5. Return the answer.

### Edge Cases

1. An empty string: This case is not possible since the input is a 6-digit string.
2. A string with less than 6 digits: This case is not possible since the input is a 6-digit string.
3. A string with non-digit characters: This case is not possible since the input is a string consisting of digits.
4. A string with leading zeros: This case is possible and has been accounted for in the algorithm.

The problem is a classic example of the ""minimum number of traps to catch a mouse"" problem, which is a well-known problem in number theory. The problem states that there is a mouse that moves from room $i$ to room $i \cdot x \mod{m}$ each second, where $m$ is the number of rooms and $x$ is the parameter of the mouse. The goal is to find the minimum number of traps needed to catch the mouse, assuming that if the mouse enters a trapped room, it will be caught immediately.

Given that $\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$, we can use the concept of the Euler's totient function, denoted by $\phi(m)$, which represents the number of positive integers less than or equal to $m$ that are relatively prime to $m$. In this case, the number of traps needed is equal to the number of distinct cycles of the mouse, which is equal to $\phi(m)$.

### Algorithm Design
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1.  Calculate the Euler's totient function $\phi(m)$, which can be calculated using the formula: $\phi(m) = m \cdot \prod_{p|q} (1 - \frac{1}{p})$, where $p$ ranges over all prime factors of $m$.
2.  Since the number of traps needed is equal to the number of distinct cycles of the mouse, we can return the value of $\phi(m)$ as the minimum number of traps needed.

### Edge Cases
The edge cases for this problem are:

*   $m = 1$: In this case, there is only one room, and the mouse will be caught immediately, so the number of traps needed is 1.
*   $x = 1$: In this case, the mouse will not move, so the number of traps needed is 1.

However, since the problem statement guarantees that $x < m$, the edge case $x = 1$ will never occur.

This problem involves finding the number of integers `x` within a given range `[L, R]` that can be expressed as the intersection of two arithmetic progressions. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, we have two arithmetic progressions:

- `a_1k + b_1`
- `a_2l + b_2`

We need to find the number of integers `x` that can be expressed as both of these progressions, within the range `[L, R]`. This means that we need to find the common values of `x` that satisfy both equations:

`x = a_1k' + b_1` and `x = a_2l' + b_2`

for some integers `k'` and `l'` greater than or equal to 0.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1.  Find the first term and the common difference of each arithmetic progression.
2.  Use the `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) function to find the greatest common divisor of `a_1` and `a_2`. This will help us determine the common difference of the intersection of the two progressions.
3.  Find the first term of the intersection progression by using the `gcd` of `a_1` and `a_2`, and the values of `b_1` and `b_2`.
4.  Use the formula for the `n-th` term of an arithmetic progression to find the number of terms in the intersection progression that fall within the range `[L, R]`.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If `a_1` and `a_2` are not coprime (i.e., their `gcd` is greater than 1), then the intersection progression will not be a simple arithmetic progression. In this case, we need to handle the intersection progression separately.
*   If the range `[L, R]` is empty or contains only one integer, then there are no solutions. In this case, we should return 0.

The problem describes a flag of Berland as a rectangular field with three equal stripes of different colors (red, green, and blue) that are parallel to each other and the sides of the flag. The task is to determine whether a given rectangular field of characters corresponds to a correct flag of Berland.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Read the dimensions of the field (n, m) and the field itself from input.
2. Initialize variables to track the color of each stripe (red, green, blue).
3. Iterate over each row of the field.
4. For each row, iterate over each character and determine the color of the current stripe.
5. Check if the color of the current stripe matches the color of the previous stripe. If not, it means we have found a new stripe, so update the color of the current stripe.
6. After iterating over all rows, check if we have exactly three stripes of different colors. If yes, print ""YES"", otherwise print ""NO"".

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the field is empty (i.e., n = 0 or m = 0), print ""NO"".
* If the field has only one row or one column, print ""NO"".
* If the field has less than three distinct colors, print ""NO"".

Ayrat is navigating an infinite field of hexagons, starting at point (0, 0) and moving along a spiral path. The problem asks us to determine his location after n moves. Each move can be considered as a step along the spiral, and we need to find the corresponding coordinates (x, y).

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a mathematical approach to analyze the pattern of the spiral. We can observe that each move increments the x-coordinate by -1 or 1 and the y-coordinate by 1 or -1, depending on the direction of the move. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the sequence of moves and how it affects the coordinates.

We can notice that the sequence of moves forms a pattern of zigzags, where each zigzag has a length of 3. Within each zigzag, the x-coordinate alternates between -1 and 1, while the y-coordinate increases by 1. This pattern repeats indefinitely.

**Algorithm Design**

Based on this analysis, we can design an algorithm to calculate the coordinates after n moves. We can use the following steps:

1.  Calculate the number of full zigzags completed (n // 3).
2.  Calculate the remaining moves after the full zigzags (n % 3).
3.  For each full zigzag, update the coordinates accordingly (x += -1, x += 1, y += 1).
4.  For the remaining moves, update the coordinates based on the direction of the last full zigzag.

**Edge Cases**

1.  If n is 0, the coordinates should be (0, 0).
2.  If n is a multiple of 3, the coordinates should be (0, n // 3).

The problem is a combinatorial one, where we need to find if it's possible for Dante to break the shield by firing bullets from his two guns, Ebony and Ivory. The key constraint is that we need to deal exactly `c` units of damage, and each bullet from Ebony deals `a` units of damage, while each bullet from Ivory deals `b` units of damage.

We can represent the problem as a linear Diophantine equation:

`a*x + b*y = c`

where `x` is the number of bullets fired from Ebony, and `y` is the number of bullets fired from Ivory.

The problem can be reduced to checking if there are integer solutions to this equation for non-negative `x` and `y`.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Check if `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). If they are not, then there are no integer solutions to the equation, and we can immediately return ""No"".
2. Check if `c` is a multiple of `a` or `b`. If it is, then there is a trivial solution where we fire `c/a` bullets from Ebony (or Ivory), and we can return ""Yes"".
3. Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, and express it as a linear combination of `a` and `b`. This will give us a solution to the equation `a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)`.
4. Scale the solution by the ratio of `c` to `gcd(a, b)` to get a solution to the original equation `a*x + b*y = c`.
5. Check if the scaled solution is non-negative. If it is, then we can return ""Yes"". Otherwise, we return ""No"".

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Iterate over the string and consider each character as the starting point of a potential substring.
2. For each starting point, expand the substring to the right until we find a character that does not match the corresponding character on the left side of the substring.
3. If we find such a character, it means that the current substring is not a palindrome, and we update the maximum length of the non-palindrome substring if necessary.

1. Initialize two variables, `zero_index` and `rightmost_zero`, to store the index of the first zero encountered and the index of the rightmost zero encountered so far, respectively.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right. For each element, check if it's zero. If it's zero:
   * Update `zero_index` to the current index.
   * Update `rightmost_zero` to the current index.
3. If the current element is not zero, calculate the distance to the nearest zero by:
   * Checking if `zero_index` is greater than the current index. If so, update the distance to `zero_index - current_index`.
   * Checking if `rightmost_zero` is less than the current index. If so, update the distance to `current_index - rightmost_zero`.
4. Print the calculated distance for each element in the array.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the input array is empty, there are no zeros to find, so we can return an empty array.
* If the input array contains a single zero, we can return an array with all elements equal to the distance between the zero and its index.
* If the input array contains multiple zeros, we need to find the distance to the nearest zero for each element.

This problem is a classic example of a ""searching and traversing"" problem. Given an array of integers, we need to find the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array.

The key insight here is that we can solve this problem in a single pass through the array. We don't need to traverse the array multiple times or use any complex data structures.

The problem asks to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain a given binary string $s$ as a substring. A cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

To solve this problem, we need to find all possible cyclical shifts of the string $s$ and count the number of distinct cyclical strings that contain these shifts.

**Algorithm Design**

We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. The idea is to build a table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct cyclical strings of length $i$ that contain the string $s$ as a substring.

We will iterate over all possible lengths $i$ from $1$ to $n$. For each length $i$, we will consider all possible cyclical shifts of the string $s$ of length $i$ and count the number of distinct cyclical strings that contain these shifts.

To count the number of distinct cyclical strings that contain a cyclical shift of $s$, we will use the fact that a cyclical string $t$ contains a cyclical shift of $s$ if and only if $t$ has the same number of $1$s as the cyclical shift of $s$.

Therefore, for each length $i$, we will iterate over all possible numbers of $1$s in the cyclical string $t$, from $0$ to $i$, and count the number of distinct cyclical strings that have this number of $1$s.

We will use the fact that a cyclical string $t$ has the same number of $1$s as the cyclical shift of $s$ if and only if the number of $1$s in $t$ is equal to the number of $1$s in the cyclical shift of $s$ modulo $i$.

* If the length of the string $s$ is greater than the length $n$, then the number of distinct cyclical strings that contain $s$ is $0$.

The problem involves finding the minimum time for Vasiliy to reach the post office, given the distance to the post office, the car's breaking distance, the driving and walking times, and the repair time. Vasiliy's car breaks every k kilometers, and he needs to repair it for t seconds before driving again.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will calculate the minimum time for Vasiliy to reach the post office for each possible remaining distance to the post office.

Let's define the following variables:

* `d`: the total distance to the post office
* `k`: the car's breaking distance
* `a`: the time to drive 1 kilometer
* `b`: the time to walk 1 kilometer
* `t`: the time to repair the car
* `min_time`: the minimum time to reach the post office

We will calculate the `min_time` for each possible remaining distance `r` to the post office, where `r` ranges from 0 to `d`. We will consider two cases:

1. Vasiliy drives the remaining distance `r` on the car. In this case, the time taken is `r * a + (r // k) * t`. We will calculate this time and update the `min_time` if it is less than the current `min_time`.
2. Vasiliy walks the remaining distance `r` on foot. In this case, the time taken is `r * b`. We will calculate this time and update the `min_time` if it is less than the current `min_time`.

We will use a loop to calculate the `min_time` for each possible remaining distance `r` to the post office.

**Edge Cases**

The edge cases for this problem are:

* If the car's breaking distance `k` is greater than or equal to the total distance `d`, then Vasiliy can simply drive the entire distance on the car.
* If the driving time `a` is less than or equal to the walking time `b`, then Vasiliy should always drive the entire distance on the car.
* If the repair time `t` is 0, then the car will never break and Vasiliy can simply drive the entire distance on the car.

4.  For each gcd, calculate the smallest number that is a multiple of gcd and is greater than the previous number in the sequence (if the sequence is not empty). This is done by dividing the total sum by gcd and rounding up to the nearest integer.

This problem involves finding the maximum sum of a consecutive subarray in a given array, with the option to multiply all values in a subarray by a certain factor. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray.

The beauty of the array can be affected in two ways:

1.  If a subarray has a negative sum, multiplying it by a factor can make the overall beauty of the array more positive.
2.  If a subarray has a positive sum, multiplying it by a factor can increase the overall beauty of the array.

We need to consider these two cases and find the maximum beauty of the array after applying at most one such operation.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1.  Find the maximum sum of a consecutive subarray in the given array using Kadane's algorithm.
2.  Initialize the maximum beauty of the array to be the maximum sum found in step 1.
3.  Iterate over the array to find the minimum sum of a consecutive subarray. If the minimum sum is negative, update the maximum beauty of the array by adding the product of the minimum sum and the factor.
4.  Return the maximum beauty of the array.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the array is empty, the maximum beauty of the array is 0.
*   If the factor is 0, the maximum beauty of the array is 0.

This problem involves finding the maximum sum of a consecutive subarray in a given array, with the option to multiply all values in a subarray by a certain factor. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray.

The beauty of the array can be affected in two ways:

1.  If a subarray has a negative sum, multiplying it by a factor can make the overall beauty of the array more positive.
2.  If a subarray has a positive sum, multiplying it by a factor can increase the overall beauty of the array.

We need to consider these two cases and find the maximum beauty of the array after applying at most one such operation.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1.  Find the maximum sum of a consecutive subarray in the given array using Kadane's algorithm.
2.  Initialize the maximum beauty of the array to be the maximum sum found in step 1.
3.  Iterate over the array to find the minimum sum of a consecutive subarray. If the minimum sum is negative, update the maximum beauty of the array by adding the product of the minimum sum and the factor.
4.  Return the maximum beauty of the array.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the array is empty, the maximum beauty of the array is 0.
*   If the factor is 0, the maximum beauty of the array is 0.
*   If the array contains only one element, the maximum beauty of the array is the value of that element.

The problem requires finding the k-th largest number in an n × m multiplication table, where the element on the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column equals i·j. The table is constructed by multiplying each row and column index.

To approach this problem, we can first generate the numbers in the table by iterating over the rows and columns and multiplying the indices. Then, we can sort these numbers in non-decreasing order and return the k-th number.

However, this approach would be inefficient for large inputs because it involves generating and sorting all the numbers in the table.

### Algorithm Design

A more efficient approach is to calculate the k-th largest number directly without generating the entire table. We can use the fact that the largest number in the table is n·m and the smallest number is 1.

We can calculate the number of numbers less than or equal to x = n·m - k + 1 by summing the first n-1 rows (which contribute n-1 + n-2 + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2 numbers), the first m-1 columns (which contribute m-1 + m-2 + ... + 1 = m(m-1)/2 numbers), and the number x itself.

Then, we can subtract this sum from n·m to get the k-th largest number.

### Edge Cases

1. When k is greater than n·m, there is no k-th largest number, so we should raise an error.
2. When n or m is 1, the problem is trivial because there is only one row or column.
3. When k is 1, the k-th largest number is n·m.
4. When k is equal to n·m, the k-th largest number is 1.

The key observation is that the number of digits in the sequence up to a certain number $n$ is $9 \cdot \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$. This is because for each number of digits $d$, there are $10^d$ possible numbers with $d$ digits, and the first $d$ digits are always $1$ to $9$, followed by $d$ zeros. Therefore, the number of numbers with $d$ digits is $10^d$, and the number of numbers with at most $d$ digits is $\sum_{i=1}^{d} 10^i = \frac{10^{d+1}-1}{9}$.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1.  Calculate the number of numbers with at most $d$ digits: $n_d = \frac{10^{d+1}-1}{9}$
2.  Calculate the number of numbers with $d+1$ digits: $n_{d+1} = 10^{d+1}$
3.  If $k \leq n_d$, then the $k$-th number has at most $d$ digits, so we can find the $k$-th number in $O(d)$ time by checking the first $10^d$ numbers.
4.  Otherwise, the $k$-th number has at least $d+1$ digits, so we can find the $k$-th number in $O(1)$ time by calculating the number of numbers with at most $d$ digits and subtracting that from $k$.

The edge cases for this problem are:

In the morning, there are n opportunities to buy shares at different prices. We can buy as many shares as we want at each price.

In the evening, there are m opportunities to sell shares at different prices. We can sell as many shares as we have, but not more.

The problem is to find the number of teams that Daniel should invite for a football tournament, such that the total number of games played is exactly `n`. The tournament format is as follows:

1. Teams are paired up and play each other until the number of teams is even.
2. At each stage, the loser of each pair is eliminated.
3. If there is only one team remaining, it is declared the winner.
4. If there are multiple teams remaining, they play a round-robin tournament against each other.
5. The total number of games played is the sum of games played at each stage.

The problem can be broken down into two cases:

* If the number of teams is even, the number of games played at each stage is 1/2 of the number of teams.
* If the number of teams is odd, the number of games played at each stage is the number of teams minus 1.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We can start with an initial number of teams and keep track of the number of games played at each stage. We can use a loop to simulate the tournament, and at each stage, we can calculate the number of games played and update the total number of games played.

We can also use a helper function to calculate the number of games played at each stage, given the number of teams.

1. Initialize an empty list to store the possible numbers of teams.
2. Iterate over all possible numbers of teams, starting from 1.
3. For each number of teams, simulate the tournament and calculate the total number of games played.
4. If the total number of games played is equal to `n`, add the number of teams to the list.
5. Return the list of possible numbers of teams.

The problem is to find the maximum possible beauty of string t, which is an antipalindromic permutation of string s. An antipalindromic string is a string of even length where each character at index i is not equal to the character at index m - i + 1.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the frequency of each character in string s.
2. Sort the characters in descending order of their frequencies.
3. For each pair of characters (a, b), where a is the character at the center of the string and b is the character at the other end, calculate the total beauty if we assign a to the first half of the string and b to the second half.
4. Return the maximum total beauty.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the length of string s is 2, then we can assign one character to each half of the string, and the total beauty is the sum of the beauties of the two characters.
* If the length of string s is even but greater than 2, then we can assign one character to the first half of the string and another character to the second half, and the total beauty is the sum of the beauties of the two characters.
* If the length of string s is even and greater than 2, but we cannot assign one character to the first half and another character to the second half, then we can assign one character to the first half and the same character to the second half, and the total beauty is the sum of the beauty of the character and its frequency.

**Algorithm Design:**
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether it's possible to balance an item of mass `i`. We'll iterate through each possible mass from 1 to `m` and for each mass, we'll check whether it's possible to balance it by considering the weights that can be placed on either pan.

Here's a high-level outline of the algorithm:

2. For each weight `w^i` from 1 to 100, for each mass `j` from `w^i` to `m`, update `dp[j]` to be the OR of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - w^i]`.
3. The final answer is `dp[m]`.

**Edge Cases:**

4.  If the sum is less than or equal to n, store the current y as the maximum value y.

The problem involves a pyramid constructed from champagne glasses, with the height of the pyramid being `n`. The task is to determine the number of completely full glasses after `t` seconds of pouring champagne from the top glass.

The champagne flows from the top glass to the glasses below, with each glass receiving an amount equal to the size of exactly one glass. If a glass is already full, the overflow pours over the edge and is equally distributed among two glasses below.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of completely full glasses in the sub-pyramid of height `i` and time `j`.

We can iterate through the pyramid levels from top to bottom and the time from 0 to `t`. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we can calculate the number of completely full glasses by considering the following cases:

* If the current glass is at the top level (i.e., `i == 1`), we can directly pour champagne into it for `j` seconds.
* If the current glass is not at the top level, we can calculate the number of completely full glasses by considering the glasses below it.

We can use the following recurrence relation to fill the `dp` array:

`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j - (i-1)]`

However, this approach is not efficient as it involves a lot of redundant calculations. A more efficient approach is to use a single array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of completely full glasses after `j` seconds.

We can iterate through the pyramid levels from top to bottom and the time from 0 to `t`. For each level `i`, we can calculate the number of completely full glasses by considering the glasses below it.

**Edge Cases**

* If the pyramid has only one level, the number of completely full glasses is equal to the time `t`.

The vertices are represented as points on a coordinate plane, and the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The problem is a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem, where we need to find the minimum number of wooden bars required to make frames for two doors. The problem has the following constraints:

- Each frame has two vertical sides of length `a` and one top side of length `b`.
- A solid piece of bar is needed for each side.
- Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts.

We need to find the minimum number of wooden bars of length `n` that can be cut and arranged to make the frames for two doors.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm that takes the following steps:

1. Calculate the total length of all sides of the frames for two doors.
2. Divide the total length by the length of each wooden bar `n` to get the minimum number of wooden bars required.
3. Since Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, we need to round up to the nearest integer to ensure that we have enough wooden bars.

However, we need to consider the cases where the length of the top side `b` is greater than the length of the wooden bar `n`. In this case, we need to use multiple wooden bars to make the top side.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

- If `a` or `b` is equal to `n`, we need to consider the case where we can use a single wooden bar to make the frame.
- If `b` is greater than `n`, we need to use multiple wooden bars to make the top side.

This problem involves determining whether it is possible to sort an array of integers in ascending order using a sequence of swaps, subject to certain constraints. The array has n elements, each of which is an integer from 1 to n, and there is a given string of length n-1 that specifies which swaps are allowed.

The problem can be broken down into the following key components:

*   The array is initially unsorted, and we need to determine whether it is possible to sort it in ascending order.
*   The allowed swaps are specified by a given string of length n-1, where a '1' at the i-th position indicates that we can swap the i-th and (i+1)-th elements, and a '0' at the i-th position indicates that we cannot swap the i-th and (i+1)-th elements.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm that iterates through the array and the allowed swaps string simultaneously. The main idea is to keep track of the current position in the array and the allowed swaps string, and perform swaps only when they are allowed.

Here is a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the positions of the elements that have not been placed in their correct positions yet.
2.  Iterate through the array and the allowed swaps string simultaneously.
3.  If the current element is not in its correct position and the swap is allowed, push the current element onto the stack and move to the next element.
4.  If the current element is in its correct position, pop an element from the stack and swap it with the current element, if it is not in its correct position.
5.  If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means that all elements have been placed in their correct positions, and we can print ""YES"". Otherwise, print ""NO"".

### Edge Cases

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the array is already sorted, the algorithm should print ""YES"".
*   If the allowed swaps string is all '0's, the algorithm should print ""NO"" if the array is not already sorted.
*   If the array has only one element, the algorithm should print ""YES"" if the element is in its correct position, and ""NO"" otherwise.

*   The allowed swaps are specified by a given string of length n-1, where a '1' at the i-th position indicates that we can swap the i-th and (i+1)-th elements, and a '0' at the i-th position indicates that we cannot swap the i-th and (i+1)-th elements.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm that iterates through the array and the allowed swaps string simultaneously. The main idea is to keep track of the current position in the array and the allowed swaps string, and perform swaps only when they are allowed.

Here is a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the positions of the elements that have not been placed in their correct positions yet.
2.  Iterate through the array and the allowed swaps string simultaneously.
3.  If the current element is not in its correct position and the swap is allowed, push the current element onto the stack and move to the next element.
4.  If the current element is in its correct position, pop an element from the stack and swap it with the current element, if it is not in its correct position.
5.  If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means that all elements have been placed in their correct positions, and we can print ""YES"". Otherwise, print ""NO"".

### Edge Cases

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the array is already sorted, the algorithm should print ""YES"".
*   If the allowed swaps string is all '0's, the algorithm should print ""NO"" if the array is not already sorted.
*   If the array has only one element, the algorithm should print ""YES"" if the element is in its correct position, and ""NO"" otherwise.

The problem describes a scenario where two flight attendants serve food to passengers in an airplane with an infinite number of rows. The attendants move in a sequence of two rows at a time, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other. The attendants serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle, first serving the seats to the right of the aisle and then the seats to the left.

We need to determine how many seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch, given his seat number in the format ns, where n is the index of the row and s is the seat in that row, denoted as a letter from 'a' to 'f'.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of seconds it takes for the attendants to reach Vasya's row.
2. Determine which attendant serves Vasya's row.
3. Calculate the number of seconds it takes for the attendant to serve Vasya's row.

To calculate the number of seconds it takes for the attendants to reach Vasya's row, we can use the formula:

seconds = (n - 1) // 2 \* 2 + (n - 1) % 2

This formula works by first calculating the number of pairs of rows that the attendants have to serve before reaching Vasya's row, and then adding the number of seconds it takes to serve the remaining row.

To determine which attendant serves Vasya's row, we can use the fact that the attendants alternate rows. If Vasya's row is even, the first attendant serves it. If Vasya's row is odd, the second attendant serves it.

To calculate the number of seconds it takes for the attendant to serve Vasya's row, we can use the following formula:

seconds = (6 - ord(s) + 1) // 2

This formula works by first calculating the number of seconds it takes to serve the passengers in the seats to the right of the aisle, and then adding the number of seconds it takes to serve the passengers in the seats to the left of the aisle.

**Edge Cases**

The following edge cases need to be considered:

* If Vasya's row is 1, the attendants will not move to the next row, so we need to handle this case separately.
* If Vasya's seat is 'f', the attendant will only need to serve","**Problem Analysis**

The problem requires us to compare two numbers represented in different bases. We are given the number of digits, the base, and the digits of each number. We need to convert these numbers to decimal (base 10) and then compare them.

### Algorithm Design
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the input: Read the number of digits, the base, and the digits of each number.
2. Convert the numbers to decimal: Use the formula for converting a number from any base to decimal: `decimal = d_{n} * b^{n} + d_{n-1} * b^{n-1} + ... + d_{0} * b^{0}`, where `d_{i}` is the digit at position `i` and `b` is the base.
3. Compare the numbers: Once we have the decimal values, we can compare them using standard comparison operators.

### Edge Cases
We need to consider the following edge cases:

* Zero digits: We should not allow a number to have zero digits. If a number has zero digits, it means the number is zero, and we should handle it accordingly.
* Leading zeroes: We should not allow leading zeroes in the input. If a number has leading zeroes, it means the number is zero, and we should handle it accordingly.
* Invalid base: We should check if the base is valid (between 2 and 40). If the base is invalid, we should raise an error.
* Invalid digit: We should check if the digit is valid (between 0 and the base-1). If the digit is invalid, we should raise an error.

The problem involves creating a new deck of cards from an existing deck by removing cards from the top and bottom. The new deck is considered valid if the product of all numbers written on the cards is divisible by a given magic number k. We need to find the number of ways to choose x and y such that the resulting deck is valid.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Preprocess the input array to find the prime factors of each number.
2. Create a prefix and suffix array to store the prime factors of the product of numbers up to each position in the array.
3. Iterate over all possible values of x and y, and for each pair, check if the product of the numbers in the new deck is divisible by k.
4. Use the prefix and suffix arrays to efficiently check if the product is divisible by k.

**Algorithm Design (continued)**

To check if the product of the numbers in the new deck is divisible by k, we can use the following approach:

1. For each prime factor p of k, count the number of occurrences of p in the prefix array.
2. For each prime factor p of k, count the number of occurrences of p in the suffix array.
3. If the number of occurrences of each prime factor p in the prefix array is greater than or equal to the number of occurrences of p in the suffix array, then the product of the numbers in the new deck is divisible by k.

**Edge Cases**

1. If n = 1, there is only one possible way to create a new deck (i.e., removing 0 cards from the top and bottom), so the answer is 1.
2. If k = 1, the product of all numbers is always divisible by k, so the answer is n^2.

The problem requires finding the minimum distance between two closest minimum values in a given array of integers. The array can contain duplicate values, and it is guaranteed that at least two minimum values exist in the array.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach based on the following steps:

1.  Create a copy of the input array and replace all values with their indices.
2.  Sort the array based on its values.
3.  Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the sorted array.
4.  Iterate through the array, expanding the distance between the two pointers whenever a smaller value is found.
5.  The minimum distance between the two pointers is the minimum distance between two minimum values in the original array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

*   Replace values with indices: `array[i] = i`
*   Sort the array by value: `array.sort(key=lambda x: x)`
*   Initialize two pointers: `left = 0` and `right = 0`
*   Iterate through the sorted array:
    *   If `array[left] > array[right]`, increment `right` to expand the distance
    *   Otherwise, increment `left` to move towards the minimum value
*   The minimum distance between the two pointers is the minimum distance between two minimum values

**Edge Cases**

The algorithm handles the following edge cases:

*   **Empty array**: If the input array is empty, the function will return an error or a special value indicating that the array is empty.
*   **Array with a single element**: If the input array contains a single element, the function will return 0, indicating that there is no distance between the two minimum values.
*   **Array with duplicate minimum values**: The algorithm can handle arrays with duplicate minimum values, as it uses a pointer-based approach to find the minimum distance.

The problem requires finding the minimum distance between two closest minimum values in a given array of integers. The array can contain duplicate values, and it is guaranteed that at least two minimum values exist in the array.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach based on the following steps:

1.  Create a copy of the input array and replace all values with their indices.
2.  Sort the array based on its values.
3.  Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the sorted array.
4.  Iterate through the array, expanding the distance between the two pointers whenever a smaller value is found.
5.  The minimum distance between the two pointers is the minimum distance between two minimum values in the original array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

*   Replace values with indices: `array[i] = i`
*   Sort the array by value: `array.sort(key=lambda x: x)`
*   Initialize two pointers: `left = 0` and `right = 0`
*   Iterate through the sorted array:
    *   If `array[left] > array[right]`, increment `right` to expand the distance
    *   Otherwise, increment `left` to move towards the minimum value
*   The minimum distance between the two pointers is the minimum distance between two minimum values

**Edge Cases**

The algorithm handles the following edge cases:

*   **Empty array**: If the input array is empty, the function will return an error or a special value indicating that the array is empty.
*   **Array with a single element**: If the input array contains a single element, the function will return 0, indicating that there is no distance between the two minimum values.
*   **Array with duplicate minimum values**: The algorithm can handle arrays with duplicate minimum values, as it uses a pointer-based approach to find the minimum distance.

The problem involves determining the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again in a race with a distance of L meters, given that they have the same speed but take steps of lengths w and b meters, respectively.

The organizers want to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in the range from 1 to t (inclusive). We need to find the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1.  Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of w and b, denoted as lcm(w, b). This is because Willman and Bolt will tie if and only if the length of the racetrack is a multiple of lcm(w, b).
2.  Calculate the number of multiples of lcm(w, b) in the range from 1 to t. This can be done by dividing t by lcm(w, b) and rounding down to the nearest integer.
3.  The probability that Willman and Bolt tie again is the ratio of the number of multiples of lcm(w, b) to the total number of possible racetrack lengths, which is t.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If lcm(w, b) is greater than t, then there are no multiples of lcm(w, b) in the range from 1 to t, and the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again is 0.
*   If lcm(w, b) is equal to 1, then Willman and Bolt will tie for all possible racetrack lengths, and the probability is 1.

The problem asks to determine the result of a voting scenario based on the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and those whose votes are unknown. The result is uncertain if there are more than one possible outcomes.

Given the numbers of upvoters (`x`), downvoters (`y`), and unknown voters (`z`), we need to determine whether the result is certain or uncertain. If the result is certain, we should print the result (""+"", ""-"", or ""0""). Otherwise, we should print ""?"".

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible scenarios where the unknown voters (`z`) vote. There are two cases:

- Case 1: Unknown voters upvote.
- Case 2: Unknown voters downvote.

For each case, we calculate the net votes (upvotes - downvotes). If the net votes are positive, the result is ""+"". If the net votes are negative, the result is ""-"". If the net votes are zero, the result is ""0"".

If the results are different between the two cases, the result is uncertain. Otherwise, the result is certain.

### Edge Cases

- When `z` is 0, there are no unknown voters, and the result is certain.
- When `x` and `y` are 0, there are no upvoters or downvoters, and the result is uncertain.

The problem involves finding the minimum length of a subsequence in a given sequence of operations that needs to be changed so that the robot ends up at a specific point on the Cartesian plane. The robot can perform four types of operations: U (move up), D (move down), L (move left), and R (move right). The goal is to find the minimum length of the subsequence that needs to be changed, which can be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum indices of the changed operations plus one.

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique. We will maintain two pointers, one at the beginning of the sequence and one at the end. We will also maintain two counters, one for the total number of moves up and one for the total number of moves down. We will also maintain two counters, one for the total number of moves left and one for the total number of moves right.

We will iterate through the sequence from both ends. For each operation, we will update the corresponding counters. If the robot ends up at the target point, we will update the minimum length of the subsequence that needs to be changed.

This problem involves generating an infinite string `t` by concatenating a given string `s` of 0s and 1s, and then finding the number of prefixes of `t` that have a balance equal to a given value `x`. The balance of a string is defined as the difference between the number of occurrences of 0 and 1.

The key observation here is that the balance of the string `t` will change only when a 0 or 1 is appended to the end of the string `s`. Since the string `s` is repeated infinitely, the balance will increase by 1 when a 0 is appended and decrease by 1 when a 1 is appended.

The problem can be solved by iterating over the string `s` and keeping track of the balance. When the balance equals the given value `x`, we increment the count of good prefixes.

**Algorithm Design**

Here is a step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Read the length `n` of the string `s` and the desired balance `x`.
2. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to keep track of the balance of the string `s`.
3. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of good prefixes.
4. Iterate over the string `s` from left to right:
   * If the current character is '0', increment the balance by 1.
   * If the current character is '1', decrement the balance by 1.
   * If the balance equals the given value `x`, increment the count of good prefixes.
5. If the count of good prefixes is still 0 at the end of the iteration, print -1, indicating that there are infinite good prefixes.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the desired balance `x` is 0, there will be no good prefixes unless the string `s` consists entirely of 0s or 1s.
* If the string `s` consists entirely of 0s or 1s, the balance will remain constant, so there will be infinite good prefixes.

The teacher asks students from the first row, then the second row, and so on, until the last row is reached. After that, the teacher asks students from the previous row, and this pattern continues.

3. How many times the teacher asked a specific student, namely, the student sitting at the `x-th` row and the `y-th` place in the row.

The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon.

The game has the following properties:

* Each player can change at most one color in their ribbon per turn.
* The game has a fixed number of turns, denoted by `n`.
* The length of each ribbon is equal.
* The game is fair, meaning that the initial ribbons of the players are random and have the same length.

The objective of the game is to determine who will win the treasure after `n` turns, assuming that all players play optimally.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach with the following steps:

1. Preprocess the ribbons to extract the subribbons and their frequencies.
2. Initialize a 3D table to store the maximum beauty that can be achieved by each player after `i` turns, given the current state of the ribbons.
3. Iterate over the table and fill it up using the following recurrence relation:
	* For each player, try to change each color in their ribbon to an arbitrary color that is different from the unchanged one.
	* For each possible change, calculate the new beauty of the ribbon and update the table accordingly.
4. Finally, determine the winner by comparing the maximum beauty achieved by each player after `n` turns.

**Edge Cases**

The following edge cases should be considered:

* If `n` is 0, the winner is the player with the most beautiful ribbon initially.
* If `n` is equal to the length of the ribbons, the winner is the player who can achieve the maximum beauty by changing their ribbon into a single color.
* If two or more players share the maximum beauty, the game ends in a draw.

This problem can be broken down into several key components:

*   Mister B starts reading a book with `c` pages at a speed of `v_0` pages per day.
*   His reading speed increases by `a` pages per day, but is capped at `v_1` pages per day.
*   Every day, he also has to reread the last `l` pages he read.
*   He finishes the book when he reads the last page for the first time.

We need to find the minimum number of days required for Mister B to finish the book.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a simulation-based approach. We'll simulate Mister B's reading process day by day, keeping track of the number of pages read and the current reading speed.

Here's a high-level outline of the algorithm:

1.  Initialize variables: `c` (book pages), `v_0` (initial reading speed), `v_1` (max reading speed), `a` (acceleration), `l` (reread pages), `days` (number of days), `pages_read` (pages read so far), and `speed` (current reading speed).
2.  On each day:
    *   If the current speed is less than the maximum speed, increment the speed by `a`.
    *   Read `min(speed, v_1)` pages.
    *   Add the pages read to the total pages read.
    *   If the last `l` pages read are within the book, increment the number of days.
3.  Repeat step 2 until the book is finished (i.e., the total pages read is at least `c`).

**Edge Cases**

*   If the book is empty (`c` is 0), the answer is 0.
*   If the initial reading speed is greater than or equal to the maximum reading speed, the answer is 1.
*   If the acceleration is 0, the answer is the ceiling of `c / v_0`.

The problem is asking to find the minimal amount of burles that organizers need to pay to satisfy all the delegations by making the number of commentary boxes divisible by the number of delegations. The organizers can build or demolish boxes arbitrary number of times, each time paying a corresponding fee.

The problem can be solved by finding the remainder of the division of the number of boxes `n` by the number of delegations `m`. If the remainder is not zero, the organizers need to build or demolish boxes to make the number of boxes divisible by `m`.

### Algorithm Design

The algorithm can be designed as follows:

1. Calculate the remainder of the division of `n` by `m`.
2. If the remainder is zero, the organizers do not need to pay any burles.
3. If the remainder is not zero, calculate the difference between `m` and the remainder. This difference is the number of boxes that need to be built or demolished.
4. Calculate the cost of building the boxes, which is `diff * a`, where `a` is the fee to build a box.
5. Calculate the cost of demolishing the boxes, which is `diff * b`, where `b` is the fee to demolish a box.
6. The minimal amount of burles that organizers need to pay is the minimum of the cost of building and the cost of demolishing.

### Edge Cases

* If `n` is not divisible by `m`, the organizers need to build or demolish boxes to make the number of boxes divisible by `m`.
* If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the organizers should build the boxes to minimize the cost.

The problem is to find the maximum sum of a subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the sum of the subsequence is odd. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain two arrays, `dp_odd` and `dp_even`, where `dp_odd[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i` with an odd sum, and `dp_even[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i` with an even sum.

We can calculate `dp_odd[i]` and `dp_even[i]` by considering the following cases:

* If the current element is odd, we can either include it in the subsequence and add its value to `dp_even[i-1]`, or exclude it and use the previous value of `dp_odd[i-1]`.
* If the current element is even, we can either include it in the subsequence and add its value to `dp_odd[i-1]`, or exclude it and use the previous value of `dp_even[i-1]`.

This problem is a classic example of a combinatorics problem with constraints. Polycarp wants to create a playlist of songs such that the total duration is exactly T minutes, and there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre. The problem also states that all songs in the playlist must be different.

The key observation here is that the only difference between the easy and hard versions of the problem is the constraints. In the hard version, the constraints are stricter, and we need to consider the genres of the songs more carefully.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to build up a table of possible playlists and their corresponding durations. We can then use this table to calculate the total number of possible playlists that satisfy the given constraints.

1. Read the input data, including the number of songs, the required total duration, and the characteristics of each song.
2. Initialize a table to store the possible playlists and their corresponding durations.
3. Iterate over the songs and for each song, consider all possible previous songs that can be played before it.
4. If the previous song is of a different genre, then we can add the current song to the playlist.
5. Update the table with the new playlist and its corresponding duration.
6. Finally, return the total number of possible playlists that satisfy the given constraints.

The key observation here is that the only difference between the easy and hard versions of the problem is the constraints. In the hard version, the constraints are stricter, and we need to consider the genres of the songs more carefully.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to build up a table of possible playlists and their corresponding durations. We can then use this table to calculate the total number of possible playlists that satisfy the given constraints.

**Algorithm Design**

Here is a high-level outline of the algorithm:

1. Read the input data, including the number of songs, the required total duration, and the characteristics of each song.
2. Initialize a table to store the possible playlists and their corresponding durations.
3. Iterate over the songs and for each song, consider all possible previous songs that can be played before it.
4. If the previous song is of a different genre, then we can add the current song to the playlist.
5. Update the table with the new playlist and its corresponding duration.
6. Finally, return the total number of possible playlists that satisfy the given constraints.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the required total duration is less than the total duration of all songs, then there are no possible playlists.
* If the number of songs is less than the required total duration, then there are no possible playlists.
* If all songs have the same genre, then there are no possible playlists.

**Python 3 Code**
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_playlists(n, T, songs):
    # Initialize a table to store the possible playlists and their corresponding durations
    dp = [[0] * (T + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]

    dp[0][0] = 1

The problem requires finding the expected length of an array `a` that Vivek initially has, with some integer constant `m`. The array is filled by appending a random integer `x` uniformly in range from 1 to `m`, and then computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers in `a`. If the GCD equals 1, the algorithm breaks; otherwise, it returns to step 1.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. However, since the problem involves finding the expected length of the array, we can use a more efficient approach by considering the probability of the GCD being 1 at each step.

Let `E(m)` be the expected length of the array when `m` is the number of possible values. We can derive a recurrence relation for `E(m)` as follows:

* If the GCD is 1, the expected length is 1 (since we can stop the algorithm).
* If the GCD is not 1, the expected length is the sum of the probabilities of appending each value `x` from 1 to `m`, and then recursively computing the expected length for the remaining values.

Using this recurrence relation, we can compute `E(m)` for each `m` and find the expected length of the array.

**Edge Cases**

* When `m` is 1, the expected length is 1, since we can only append 1 value.
* When `m` is 2, the expected length is 2, since we can append either 1 or 2 with equal probability.

This problem involves finding the number of pairs of integers (a, b) within a given range [l, r] that satisfy the conditions GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y. 

We know that for any two numbers a and b, their product is equal to the product of their GCD and LCM. Therefore, we have:

a * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)

Given GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, we can rewrite this as:

1. Iterate over all possible values of a within the range [l, r].
2. For each value of a, calculate the corresponding value of b using the formula:

b = (x * y) / a

Since a and b must be integers, we need to check whether (x * y) / a is an integer. If it is, then a and b form a valid pair.

The problem is about finding the minimum number of additional marks that Leha needs to add to Noora's marks in order to achieve a final mark of `k` in her graduation certificate.

The final mark is calculated as the average of all marks rounded to the closest integer. This means that if the average is an integer, it is the final mark. If the average is not an integer, it is rounded up to the next integer.

Given the constraints:

*   The number of marks `n` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

The cost of each shovel is equal to its position in the list of shovels (i.e., the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, and so on).

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can iterate through all possible pairs of shovels and calculate the total cost of each pair. We can then count the number of pairs that end with the maximum possible number of 9s.

However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large inputs. We can optimize this approach by using a mathematical property of numbers that end with 9s.

A number ends with 9s if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. We can use this property to count the number of pairs that end with 9s.

Here's the optimized algorithm:

1. Calculate the maximum number of 9s that can be achieved by summing the digits of the shovels.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will store the number of pairs that end with the maximum possible number of 9s.
3. Iterate through all possible pairs of shovels and calculate the total cost of each pair.
4. For each pair, check if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. If it is, increment the `count` variable.
5. Return the `count` variable as the result.

However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large inputs. We can optimize this approach by using a mathematical property of numbers that end with 9s.

A number ends with 9s if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. We can use this property to count the number of pairs that end with 9s.

Here's the optimized algorithm:

1. Calculate the maximum number of 9s that can be achieved by summing the digits of the shovels.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will store the number of pairs that end with the maximum possible number of 9s.
3. Iterate through all possible pairs of shovels and calculate the total cost of each pair.
4. For each pair, check if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. If it is, increment the `count` variable.
5. Return the `count` variable as the result.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If n is less than or equal to 1, there are no pairs to consider, so the result is 0.
* If n is 2, there is only one pair to consider (i.e., the pair consisting of the two shovels), so the result is 1.
* If n is 3, there are three pairs to consider, but only one of them ends with 9s (i.e., the pair consisting of the first and third shovels), so the result is 1.

This problem can be broken down into two main parts:

1.  Calculate the total number of squares in each chocolate bar.
2.  Find the minimum number of operations (minutes) required to make the two bars have the same number of squares.

The problem involves two types of operations: eating half of a bar and eating one-third of a bar. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to balance the number of squares in both bars.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1.  Calculate the total number of squares in each bar.
2.  Initialize a queue with the initial sizes of both bars and the number of operations (0).
3.  Create a set to store the visited states (to avoid infinite loops).
4.  Loop through the queue and perform the following operations:
    *   Check if the current state is valid (i.e., the number of squares is the same for both bars).
    *   If the state is valid, print the current state and exit the loop.
    *   If the state is not valid, generate the next states by applying the two operations (eating half of a bar and eating one-third of a bar) and add them to the queue.
    *   Remove the current state from the queue.
5.  If the loop completes without finding a valid state, print -1.

*   If the input bars have different sizes but can be balanced using the given operations, the minimum number of operations is 1.

The problem involves a game played on an infinite chessboard with two players, Polycarp and Vasiliy. Each player has a pawn that can move in certain ways, and the goal is to reach the cell (0, 0) first. The game has additional restrictions on the movements of the pawns.

The problem can be broken down into two main parts:

1. Determining the possible moves for each player.
2. Finding the optimal strategy to reach the cell (0, 0) first.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can use a graph-based approach. We can represent the infinite chessboard as a graph, where each cell is a node, and the edges represent the possible moves between cells.

For Polycarp's pawn, the possible moves are (x - 1, y) and (x, y - 1), which means we can add edges from each node (x, y) to the nodes (x - 1, y) and (x, y - 1).

For Vasiliy's pawn, the possible moves are (x - 1, y), (x - 1, y - 1), and (x, y - 1), which means we can add edges from each node (x, y) to the nodes (x - 1, y), (x - 1, y - 1), and (x, y - 1).

We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from each pawn's starting position to the cell (0, 0). This will give us the minimum number of moves required for each player to reach the cell (0, 0).

If Polycarp's pawn can reach the cell (0, 0) in fewer moves than Vasiliy's pawn, then Polycarp wins. Otherwise, Vasiliy wins.

* If both pawns start at the same position, the game is a draw.

2. Iterate over all possible segments in increasing order of their length.
3. For each segment, find the layer where it can be placed without overlapping with other segments.
4. If the segment can be placed in a layer, update the maximum end point of that layer.
5. If the segment cannot be placed in any existing layer, create a new layer for it.

*   Choose a position `pos` and increase `v[pos]` by `k^i`, where `i` is the current step number (0-indexed).

We need to decide how to apply these operations and when to stop to achieve the desired array `a`.

The problem constraints are:

*   The value `k` used in the algorithm is at least 2 and at most 100.
*   The elements of the arrays `a` are non-negative integers at most 10^16.

2.  For each element `a[i]`, iterate from the largest power of `k` that is less than or equal to `a[i]` down to 0.
3.  For each power `j` of `k`, check whether `a[i]` is greater than or equal to the value of `v[i]` that would be obtained by adding `k^j` to the current value of `v[i]`. If it is, then it's possible to achieve the desired value `a[i]` by adding `k^j` to `v[i]`.

*   If the value `k` is 1, we should return ""YES"" because we can simply add 1 to each element of the array `v` to achieve the array `a`.

**Python 3","**Problem Analysis**

The problem is asking us to determine whether it's possible to achieve a given array `a` by performing a series of operations on an initially empty array `v`. The operations allowed are:

*   Choose a position `pos` and increase `v[pos]` by `k^i`, where `i` is the current step number (0-indexed).

We need to decide how to apply these operations and when to stop to achieve the desired array `a`.

The problem constraints are:

*   The size of the arrays `v` and `a` is at most 30.
*   The value `k` used in the algorithm is at least 2 and at most 100.
*   The elements of the arrays `a` are non-negative integers at most 10^16.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can iterate over each element in the array `a`. For each element, we need to check whether it's possible to achieve the desired value by performing the allowed operations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  Iterate over each element `a[i]` in the array `a`.
2.  For each element `a[i]`, iterate from the largest power of `k` that is less than or equal to `a[i]` down to 0.
3.  For each power `j` of `k`, check whether `a[i]` is greater than or equal to the value of `v[i]` that would be obtained by adding `k^j` to the current value of `v[i]`. If it is, then it's possible to achieve the desired value `a[i]` by adding `k^j` to `v[i]`.
4.  If we can achieve the desired value `a[i]` for all elements `a[i]`, then we return ""YES"". Otherwise, we return ""NO"".

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the array `a` is empty, we should return ""YES"" because we can simply do nothing and achieve the empty array.
*   If the array `a` is all zeros, we should return ""YES"" because we can simply do nothing and achieve the array of zeros.
*   If the value `k` is 1, we should return ""YES"" because we can simply add 1 to each element of the array `v` to achieve the array `a`.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax","### Problem Analysis

This problem involves calculating the sum of the number of divisors for all possible products of three integers within the given ranges. The number of divisors of a positive integer `n` can be calculated using its prime factorization.

For a positive integer `n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an`, where `p1, p2, ..., pn` are distinct prime numbers and `a1, a2, ..., an` are positive integers, the number of divisors `d(n)` is given by `(a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (an + 1)`.

The product `i * j * k` can be expressed as `p1^x1 * p2^x2 * ... * pn^xn`, where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the exponents of the prime factors of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The number of divisors `d(i * j * k)` is then `(x1 + 1) * (x2 + 1) * ... * (xn + 1)`.

To calculate the sum, we need to consider all possible combinations of prime factors and their exponents for all products `i * j * k`.

### Algorithm Design

The algorithm to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1.  Calculate the prime factorization of all numbers from 1 to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2.  For each combination of prime factors and their exponents for all products `i * j * k`, calculate the number of divisors `d(i * j * k)`.
3.  Sum up all the calculated values of `d(i * j * k)`.

To optimize the algorithm, we can use the following approaches:

*   Use a hash map to store the prime factorization of each number, allowing for efficient lookup and calculation of the number of divisors.
*   Use dynamic programming to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

The problem requires checking if an array of integers is unimodal. An array is unimodal if it has the following properties:

- It is strictly increasing in the beginning.
- After that, it is constant.
- After that, it is strictly decreasing.

Both the first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent, and it is allowed that both of these blocks are absent.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple and efficient algorithm that checks the conditions of unimodality. Here are the steps:

1. Find the index of the peak element (the maximum value in the array).
2. Check if the array is increasing from the beginning to the peak index.
3. Check if the array is constant from the peak index to the end.
4. If the array is constant, then it is unimodal. Otherwise, it is not unimodal.

However, this algorithm does not work when the first block (increasing) or the last block (decreasing) is absent. To handle these cases, we can modify the algorithm as follows:

1. Initialize a flag to indicate if the array is unimodal (default is False).
2. Iterate through the array from the first element to the last element.
3. If the current element is greater than the previous element, then the array is increasing, and we update the flag to True.
4. If the current element is equal to the previous element, then the array is constant, and we continue to the next element.
5. If the current element is less than the previous element, then the array is decreasing, and we check if the flag is True. If it is, then the array is unimodal, and we update the flag to False. Otherwise, the array is not unimodal, and we break the loop.

* An empty array is not unimodal.
* An array with a single element is unimodal.

The problem is to determine whether a ball on a rectangular billiard table will fall into a pocket eventually and if yes, which pocket it will be. The table has four pockets, and the ball moves indefinitely long until it falls into a pocket. The ball's movement is determined by its initial position and speed, which can be parallel to one of the axes or make a 45-degree angle with them.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can simulate the ball's movement by iterating over the possible directions of movement (parallel to the x-axis, parallel to the y-axis, or 45-degree angle). We can use a loop to simulate the ball's movement in each direction and check if it falls into a pocket. If it does, we can print the coordinates of the pocket and exit the loop. If the ball does not fall into a pocket after simulating all possible directions, we can conclude that it will move indefinitely and print -1.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the ball's initial position is already in a pocket, we should print -1.
* If the ball's speed is zero, we should print -1.
* If the ball's speed is parallel to one of the axes, we should only simulate movement in that direction.
* If the ball's speed makes a 45-degree angle with the axes, we should simulate movement in both x and y directions.

The problem is to determine whether a ball on a rectangular billiard table will fall into a pocket eventually and if yes, which pocket it will be. The table has four pockets, and the ball moves indefinitely long until it falls into a pocket. The ball's movement is determined by its initial position and speed, which can be parallel to one of the axes or make a 45-degree angle with them.

**Algorithm Design**

To solve this problem, we can simulate the ball's movement by iterating over the possible directions of movement (parallel to the x-axis, parallel to the y-axis, or 45-degree angle). We can use a loop to simulate the ball's movement in each direction and check if it falls into a pocket. If it does, we can print the coordinates of the pocket and exit the loop. If the ball does not fall into a pocket after simulating all possible directions, we can conclude that it will move indefinitely and print -1.

**Edge Cases**

Here are some edge cases to consider:

* If the ball's initial position is already in a pocket, we should print -1.
* If the ball's speed is zero, we should print -1.
* If the ball's speed is parallel to one of the axes, we should only simulate movement in that direction.
* If the ball's speed makes a 45-degree angle with the axes, we should simulate movement in both x and y directions.

n, m, x, y, vx, vy = map(int, input().split())

# Check if ball's initial position is already in a pocket
if (x == 0 and y == 0) or (x == n and y == 0) or (x == 0 and y == m) or (x == n and y == m):
    print(-1)

The problem involves determining whether it is possible to place two paintings on a board with a given size, without overlapping or going beyond the edge of the board. The paintings can be rotated, but one side of each painting must be parallel to the floor, and one side of the board must be parallel to the floor.

### Algorithm Design

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach by considering all possible placements of the paintings on the board. We will iterate over all possible combinations of rotations for the paintings and check if the paintings can be placed on the board without overlapping or going beyond the edge.

Here's a step-by-step algorithm:

1. Read the dimensions of the board (a1, b1) and the dimensions of the paintings (a2, b2, a3, b3).
2. For each pair of paintings, try all possible rotations (i.e., (a2, b2) and (a3, b3) can be swapped, and each can be rotated by 90 degrees).
3. Check if the paintings can be placed on the board without overlapping or going beyond the edge by considering all possible placements of the first painting on the board, and then placing the second painting on the board.
4. If the paintings can be placed on the board, return ""YES"". Otherwise, return ""NO"".

### Edge Cases

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the board is too small to hold either painting, return ""NO"".
*   If the paintings are the same size and have the same rotation, return ""NO"".
*   If one painting is larger than the board, return ""NO"".

The problem requires calculating the number of integers in a geometric progression that can be written on the board without exceeding a certain limit and without writing any ""bad"" integers. The geometric progression is defined by an initial term `b1` and a common ratio `q`. The limit is given by an integer `l`. The ""bad"" integers are given in a list of integers.

The problem can be solved by generating the terms of the geometric progression, skipping the ""bad"" integers, and counting the number of terms that do not exceed the limit.

### Algorithm Design

Here is a step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1.  Read the initial term `b1`, the common ratio `q`, the limit `l`, and the number of ""bad"" integers `m`.
2.  Read the list of ""bad"" integers.
3.  Initialize a counter `count` to keep track of the number of terms that can be written on the board.
4.  Initialize a variable `current_term` to the initial term `b1`.
5.  While the current term does not exceed the limit and is not a ""bad"" integer:
    *   Increment the counter `count`.
    *   If the current term is a ""bad"" integer, break the loop.
    *   Update the current term by multiplying it with the common ratio `q`.
6.  If the current term exceeds the limit, print ""inf"". Otherwise, print the counter `count`.

### Edge Cases

Here are some edge cases to consider:

*   If the initial term `b1` is a ""bad"" integer, the counter `count` should be 0.
*   If the common ratio `q` is 0, the geometric progression is constant, and the counter `count` should be 1 if the initial term `b1` does not exceed the limit.

--- NEW PROBLEM ---
Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the","Here are the solutions to the new problems:

--- NEW PROBLEM ---
Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].

You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! 

 $m$ 

Initially Zmei Gorynich has $x$ heads. You can deal $n$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $i$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $min(d_i, curX)$, there $curX$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $h_i$ new heads. If $curX = 0$ then Gorynich is defeated. 

You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.

For example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.

Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.

The following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th blow.


-----Output-----

For each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich.

You are given a matrix of integers of size $n \times m$, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers.

For each cell $(i,j)$ in the matrix, you can change its value to any integer between $0$ and $10^9$.

Your goal is to change the values of the cells in the matrix such that the number of distinct values in each row is equal to $1$, and the number of distinct values in each column is equal to $2$.

In other words, for each row, you should have exactly one unique value, and for each column, you should have exactly two unique values.

Your task is to find the minimum number of changes required to achieve this.

Note that you can change the value of a cell to any integer between $0$ and $10^9$, but you cannot change the value of a cell to the same value that already exists in the same row or column.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 100$) — the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

The next $n$ lines contain $m$ integers each, representing the matrix. The integers are between $1$ and $100$ inclusive.

A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than ""("" and "")"". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters ""+"" and ""1"" into this sequence. For example, """", ""(())"" and ""()()"" are regular bracket sequences; ""))"" and "")(("" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and ""(a)"" and ""(1)+(1)"" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings ""(("", $cnt_2$ strings ""()"", $cnt_3$ strings "")("" and $cnt_4$ strings ""))"". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.

The problem is asking us to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, and the examples are the first several tests.

We can use a dictionary to store the mapping between the original file names and the new file names.

We first initialize two lists, one for the examples and one for the regular tests. We then iterate over the input lines, and for each line, we split it into the file name and the type. If the type is 1, we add the file name to the examples list; otherwise, we add it to the regular tests list.

We then iterate over the examples list and the regular tests list, and for each file name, we assign it a new file name that is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6. We store the mapping between the original file name and the new file name in the dictionary.

We then print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file, which is the number of files that need to be renamed.

We then iterate over the dictionary and print the script file, each line should be ""move file_1 file_2"", where ""file_1"" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and ""file_2"" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

To solve this problem, you can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the Euler's totient function of m, denoted as φ(m). This can be done using the formula φ(m) = m * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk), where p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of m.

2. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and m, denoted as gcd(x, m). This can be done using the Euclidean algorithm.

3. If gcd(x, m) = 1, then the minimum number of traps needed to catch the x-mouse is φ(m).

4. If gcd(x, m) ≠ 1, then the minimum number of traps needed to catch the x-mouse is m - 1.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:","import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b

SyntaxError: invalid syntax","--- NEW PROBLEM ---
You are given a sequence of $n$ elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and an integer $k$.

Find the number of sequences $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:



 $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$

 $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$.

In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value.

It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$): the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 100$): the number of elements in the given sequences.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 100$).

The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 100$).

The fourth line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 100$).

It is guaranteed that $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$ for all $i$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $n$ integers: $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$, $p_i \neq p_{i \mod n + 1}$).

Vasiliy has a car and he wants to get from home to the post office. The distance which he needs to pass equals to d kilometers.

Vasiliy's car is not new — it breaks after driven every k kilometers and Vasiliy needs t seconds to repair it. After repairing his car Vasiliy can drive again (but after k kilometers it will break again, and so on). In the beginning of the trip the car is just from repair station.

To drive one kilometer on car Vasiliy spends a seconds, to walk one kilometer on foot he needs b seconds (a < b).

Your task is to find minimal time after which Vasiliy will be able to reach the post office. Consider that in every moment of time Vasiliy can left his car and start to go on foot.


-----Input-----

The first line contains 5 positive integers d, k, a, b, t (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^12; 1 ≤ k, a, b, t ≤ 10^6; a < b), where:  d — the distance from home to the post office;  k — the distance, which car is able to drive before breaking;  a — the time, which Vasiliy spends to drive 1 kilometer on his car;  b — the time, which Vasiliy spends to walk 1 kilometer on foot;  t — the time, which Vasiliy spends to repair his car. 


-----Output-----

Print the minimal time after which Vasiliy will be able to reach the post office.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example Vasiliy needs to drive the first 2 kilometers on the car (in 2 seconds) and then to walk on foot 3 kilometers (in 12 seconds). So the answer equals to 14 seconds.

In the second example Vasiliy needs to drive the first 2 kilometers on the car (in 2 seconds), then repair his car (in 5 seconds) and drive 2 kilometers more on the car (in 2 seconds). After that he needs to walk on foot 1 kilometer (in 4 seconds). So the answer equals to 13 seconds.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. Beauty of array is the maximum sum of some consecutive subarray of this array (this subarray may be empty). For example, the beauty of the array [10, -5, 10, -4, 1] is 15, and the beauty of the array [-3, -5, -1] is 0.

You may choose at most one consecutive subarray of $a$ and multiply all values contained in this subarray by $x$. You want to maximize the beauty of array after applying at most one such operation.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, -100 \le x \le 100$) — the length of array $a$ and the integer $x$ respectively.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the array $a$.

Welcome to Codeforces Stock Exchange! We're pretty limited now as we currently allow trading on one stock, Codeforces Ltd. We hope you'll still be able to make profit from the market!

In the morning, there are $n$ opportunities to buy shares. The $i$-th of them allows to buy as many shares as you want, each at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

In the evening, there are $m$ opportunities to sell shares. The $i$-th of them allows to sell as many shares as you want, each at the price of $b_i$ bourles. You can't sell more shares than you have.

It's morning now and you possess $r$ bourles and no shares.

What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.

You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$.

For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$.

Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:



 $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$

 $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$.

In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value.

Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle.  [Image] 

 

It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.

Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one — in seat 'c'. Assume that all seats are occupied.

Vasya has seat s in row n and wants to know how many seconds will pass before he gets his lunch.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) is the index of the row and s is the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'. The index of the row and the seat are not separated by a space.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch.

Vector Willman and Array Bolt are the two most famous athletes of Byteforces. They are going to compete in a race with a distance of L meters today.

 [Image] 

Willman and Bolt have exactly the same speed, so when they compete the result is always a tie. That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. 

While watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to w meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to b meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). 

Note that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance L.

Since the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to t (both are included). What is the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today?

It is because:  if $l = 3$ and $r = 3$ we will have a permutation $[1]$ for $m = 1$;  if $l = 3$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 3$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 5$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 6$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$ for $m = 6$;  it is impossible to take some $l$ and $r$, such that $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$ for $m = 2$ and for $m = 4$.

You are given an array of $n$ integers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Your task is to find some non-zero integer $d$ ($-10^3 \leq d \leq 10^3$) such that, after each number in the array is divided by $d$, the number of positive numbers that are presented in the array is greater than or equal to half of the array size (i.e., at least $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$). Note that those positive numbers do not need to be an integer (e.g., a $2.5$ counts as a positive number). If there are multiple values of $d$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.

You are given a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and an integer $k$. The sequence is called ""good"" if for each $i$ from $1$ to $n - 1$, the following condition is met:

  $a_i \cdot a_{i+1} \le k$ 

Your task is to determine how many ""good"" subsequences exist.  A subsequence of the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is called ""good"" if for each $i$ from $1$ to $n - 1$, the condition $a_i \cdot a_{i+1} \le k$ is met. Note that the empty subsequence is considered to be ""good"".

For example, if $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 3$, $a_3 = 4$, $a_4 = 5$ and $k = 6$, then the following subsequences are ""good"": [], [2], [3], [4], [5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5].


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le k \le 1000$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ from all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $100 \cdot 100$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the number of ""good"" subsequences of the given sequence.

3.  Iterate over the sorted painters. For each painter, consider two cases:

    To solve the first problem, let's analyze the situation step by step:
                                   ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)","To solve the first problem, let's analyze the situation step by step:

We are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. We need to find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfies the following conditions:

$p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$

$p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$.

We can start by considering the first element of the sequence $p_1$. We can choose any of the three options $a_1, b_1, c_1$ for $p_1$. Let's say we choose $a_1$ for $p_1$. Then, we need to choose a value for $p_2$ such that $p_2 \neq p_1$. We can choose any of the three options $b_2, c_2$ for $p_2$. Let's say we choose $b_2$ for $p_2$. Then, we need to choose a value for $p_3$ such that $p_3 \neq p_2$. We can choose any of the three options $c_3, a_3$ for $p_3$. Let's say we choose $c_3$ for $p_3$. We can continue this process until we have chosen values for all elements of the sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.

However, we need to make sure that the sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ is valid, i.e., no two adjacent elements are equal. We can achieve this by always choosing a value for the next element of the sequence that is different from the value of the previous element.

To implement this in code, we can use a simple iterative approach. We can initialize the first element of the sequence $p_1$ with the value of $a_1$. Then, we can iterate over the rest of the elements of the sequence. For each element, we can choose a value that is different from the value of the previous element. We can use a simple if-else statement to choose the value of the next","To solve the first problem, let's analyze the situation step by step:

We are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. We need to find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfies the following conditions:

$p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$

$p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$.

We can start by considering the first element of the sequence $p_1$. We can choose any of the three options $a_1, b_1, c_1$ for $p_1$. Let's say we choose $a_1$ for $p_1$. Then, we need to choose a value for $p_2$ such that $p_2 \neq p_1$. We can choose any of the three options $b_2, c_2$ for $p_2$. Let's say we choose $b_2$ for $p_2$. Then, we need to choose a value for $p_3$ such that $p_3 \neq p_2$. We can choose any of the three options $c_3, a_3$ for $p_3$. Let's say we choose $c_3$ for $p_3$. We can continue this process until we have chosen values for all elements of the sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.

However, we need to make sure that the sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ is valid, i.e., no two adjacent elements are equal. We can achieve this by always choosing a value for the next element of the sequence that is different from the value of the previous element.

To implement this in code, we can use a simple iterative approach. We can initialize the first element of the sequence $p_1$ with the value of $a_1$. Then, we can iterate over the rest of the elements of the sequence. For each element, we can choose a value that is different from the value of the previous element.

**Problem 1: Three Sequences**

Let's analyze the problem:

* We have three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$.
* Each element in the sequences is distinct.
* We need to find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ that satisfies two conditions:
	1. $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$ for all $i$.
	2. $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$ for all $i$.

The problem statement guarantees that a solution always exists.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can start by choosing any of the three sequences, say $a_i$. Then, for each subsequent element $i$, we can choose any of the three sequences that is different from the previous element $p_{i-1}$.

0014,few_shot_cot,FAIL,"Mismatch on test 1: expected 3 2 1 5 4 , got -1","To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the process of stacking elements. We can see that if an element $x$ is on top of the stack, the next element that is smaller than $x$ will be the first element that will be popped from the stack. This is because all the elements smaller than $x$ will be pushed onto the stack before $x$, and the next element that is smaller than $x$ will be the first element to be popped.

Based on this observation, we can develop an algorithm to restore the remaining elements of the permutation. We can start by sorting the given elements in descending order, and then iteratively pushing them onto the stack. For each element, we can check if it is smaller than the current top element of the stack. If it is, we can pop the top element from the stack and append it to the end of the permutation.

2. Initialize two pointers, one at the start of the string and one at the end of the string.
3. Compare the characters at the two pointers. If they are the same, move both pointers towards the center of the string.
4. If the characters at the two pointers are different, the string is not a ""s-palindrome"".
5. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the string is a ""s-palindrome"".

    To solve the first problem, you can use a greedy approach. The idea is to choose the smallest available number for each position in the sequence, making sure that no two adjacent elements are equal. You can start with the first number and then move to the next number that is different from the previous one.

To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the sum of the first three digits and the sum of the last three digits. If these sums are equal, then the ticket is already lucky, and we can return 0.

If the sums are not equal, then we need to find the minimum number of digits to replace to make the ticket lucky.

We can use a brute force approach and try all possible combinations of replacing digits.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

2. For each test case, read the three sequences and store them in separate arrays.
3. Initialize the first element of the answer array as the first element of the first sequence.
4. For each subsequent element in the answer array, check if it is equal to the previous element. If it is, choose the next element from the second sequence. Otherwise, choose the next element from the third sequence.
5. If the last element in the answer array is equal to the first element, add the last element of the second sequence to the answer array. Otherwise, add the last element of the third sequence to the answer array.

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '5 2 1 4 10'","To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios of how Vasiliy can travel from home to the post office. 

First, let's consider the case when Vasiliy doesn't leave his car at all. In this case, he will break his car every k kilometers and will need to spend t seconds to repair it. The total time will be the time spent driving plus the time spent repairing the car. 

The time spent driving is d/k * a, where d is the total distance and k is the distance the car can travel before breaking. The time spent repairing the car is (d % k) * t / k + (d // k - 1) * t, where d % k is the remaining distance to the next repair point and d // k is the number of complete k-kilometer segments.

However, there's a better way to approach this problem. We can simply calculate the time it would take to walk the entire distance and compare it to the time it would take to drive with repairs. 

If the time to walk is less than the time to drive with repairs, then it's better to walk. If the time to drive with repairs is less than the time to walk, then it's better to drive. 

Here's a Python code that implements this approach:","def solve():

1.  We can start by finding the prime factorization of the given number n. This will help us to find the factors of n that are used in the sequence.
2.  Then, we can sort the prime factors in descending order. This is because we want the sequence to be strictly increasing, so we should start with the largest factors.
3.  Next, we can iterate over the sorted prime factors. For each factor, we can calculate the number of times it should appear in the sequence. We can do this by dividing n by the current factor and taking the floor of the result. This will give us the number of times the current factor should appear in the sequence.
4.  We can then append the current factor to the sequence the number of times it should appear.
5.  Finally, we can check if the length of the sequence is equal to k. If it is, we have found a valid sequence and we can print it. If not, we can try to add more factors to the sequence by dividing n by the current factor and taking the floor of the result. We can repeat this process until the length of the sequence is equal to k or until n is 1.
6.  If we are unable to find a valid sequence, we can print -1.

**Problem 1:**

The problem statement asks to find a sequence `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` such that `p_i` is one of `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i` and `p_i != p_{(i mod n) + 1}`.

We can observe that we can choose any element from the sequences `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i` for the first element `p_1`.

We are given the length of each wooden bar `n` and the lengths of the vertical and top sides of the door frame `a` and `b` respectively.

Our goal is to find the minimum number of wooden bars needed to make the frames for two doors.

We can start by analyzing the constraints:

* The total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is `2 * (2 * a + b)`.
* Since each wooden bar has length `n`, we need to find the minimum number of bars that can cover the total length.

To do this, we can divide the total length by `n` and round up to the nearest integer, since we can't use a fraction of a bar.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:","import math

n = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

**Problem 1: Three Sequences**

*   We are given three sequences: `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`; `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n`; `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`.
*   We need to find a sequence `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` such that:

    *   No two adjacent elements (`p_i` and `p_{(i mod n) + 1}`) are equal.

Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.

Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).

**Problem 1:**

The problem asks to find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ that satisfies the following conditions:

* $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$
* $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$

The problem can be solved by iterating over the sequences $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ and choosing a value for each $p_i$ that satisfies the conditions. The key insight is that since $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, and $b_i \neq c_i$, we can always find a value for each $p_i$ that is different from the previous value.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1.  Read the dimensions of the depot (n x m) and the field description.
2.  Count the number of walls in the depot. If there are no walls, print ""YES"" and the coordinates (1, 1).
3.  Initialize a flag to indicate whether it's possible to wipe out all walls by placing the bomb in a row or column that has at least one wall.
4.  Iterate over each row and column in the depot. If a row or column has at least one wall, set the flag to True.
5.  If the flag is False, it means that no row or column has at least one wall. In this case, it's impossible to wipe out all walls, so print ""NO"".
6.  If the flag is True, it means that there is at least one row or column with at least one wall. In this case, find the row or column with the maximum number of walls. If there are multiple rows or columns with the same maximum number of walls, choose any one of them.

1.  We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. We can use the `math.gcd()` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and then use the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)` to find the LCM.
2.  Let's assume `k` is the optimal integer. Then, the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` should be the smallest possible. This means that `a + k` and `b + k` should be as close as possible to each other.
3.  We can use the fact that `a + k` and `b + k` are consecutive multiples of the LCM of `a` and `b`. So, we can find the smallest `k` such that `a + k` and `b + k` are consecutive multiples of the LCM of `a` and `b`.
4.  To find the smallest `k`, we can iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to the LCM of `a` and `b`, and check if `a + k` and `b + k` are consecutive multiples of the LCM of `a` and `b`. If we find such a `k`, we can return it as the smallest optimal `k`.

You are given an array of $n$ integers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Your task is to find some non-zero integer $d$ ($-10^3 \leq d \leq 10^3$) such that, after each number in the array is divided by $d$, the number of positive numbers that are presented in the array is greater than or equal to half of the array size (i.e., at least $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$). Note that those positive numbers do not need to be an integer (e.g., a $2.5$ counts as a positive number). If there are multiple values of $d$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $d$, print a single integer $0$.

Recall that $\lceil x \rceil$ represents the smallest integer that is not less than $x$ and that zero ($0$) is neither positive nor negative.

To solve this problem, we can iterate over all possible values of $d$ and check if the number of positive numbers in the array is greater than or equal to half of the array size. If we find such a value of $d$, we can print it and exit the loop. If we don't find any value of $d$ that satisfies the condition, we can print $0$.

We can achieve this by converting the number to a string and then sorting its digits in descending order. However, this approach would result in a number that is not the largest possible, because the leading zeros would make the number smaller.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the number to a string to easily access its digits.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
3. Iterate over the digits in the given number from right to left (i.e., from least significant to most significant).
4. For each digit, check if the current number and the number formed by removing the current digit and appending the new digit to the left of the remaining digits are both less than or equal to the given number.
5. If both numbers are valid, choose the one with the maximum sum of digits.
6. Append the chosen digit to the result string.
7. If a digit is removed from the given number, subtract its value from the given number.

### Problem: Minimum Time to Close Tabs

We need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened.

### Step 1: Define the Problem

The problem can be broken down into two parts:

1.  Find the minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the left of the cursor.
2.  Find the minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the right of the cursor.

### Step 2: Calculate the Minimum Number of Seconds to Close Tabs to the Left

To close all the tabs to the left of the cursor, Luba can move the cursor to the left until it reaches the minimum index of the unclosed tab (a). The minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the left is the difference between the current position of the cursor (pos) and the minimum index of the unclosed tab (a).

### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Number of Seconds to Close Tabs to the Right

To close all the tabs to the right of the cursor, Luba can move the cursor to the right until it reaches the maximum index of the unclosed tab (b). The minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the right is the difference between the maximum index of the unclosed tab (b) and the current position of the cursor (pos).

### Step 4: Combine the Results

The minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened is the sum of the minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the left and the minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the right.

### Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def min_time(n, pos, l, r):
    # Calculate the minimum index of the unclosed tab
    a = max(l - 1, 1)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the left
    left_time = max(0, pos - a)
    
    # Calculate the maximum index of the unclosed tab
    b = min(r, n)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of seconds to close all the tabs to the right
    right_time = max(0, b - pos)

We can start by noticing that the number of heads of Zmei Gorynich changes in a non-monotonic way. At each step, the number of heads decreases by at most `d_i` and increases by at most `h_i`.

To find the minimum number of blows required to defeat Zmei Gorynich, we can use a greedy approach. We can sort the blows in ascending order of `d_i - h_i` and then iterate over the blows. For each blow, we can calculate the number of heads after applying the blow and check if Zmei Gorynich is defeated. If Zmei Gorynich is defeated, we can return the number of blows applied so far.

The problem is asking us to determine the number of days it takes for the barn to become empty for the first time.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1.  Initialize variables to keep track of the remaining grains and the number of days.
2.  In each iteration, add the number of grains brought to the barn. If the barn is full, add the excess grains to the remaining grains.
3.  Calculate the number of sparrows that come on the current day, which is the same as the number of the day.
4.  Subtract the number of grains eaten by the sparrows from the remaining grains.
5.  If the remaining grains become zero or negative, it means the barn has become empty. Return the current day as the answer.

Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a k","--- NEW PROBLEM TO SOLVE ---

To find the minimum and maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars, we need to consider the different scenarios based on the number of days in a year.

### Step 1: Calculate the minimum possible number of days off
The minimum possible number of days off will occur when the number of days in a year is a multiple of 7 (the number of work days and days off in a Martian week). In this case, the number of days off will be the same as the number of days off in a Martian week, which is 2.

### Step 2: Calculate the maximum possible number of days off
The maximum possible number of days off will occur when the number of days in a year is not a multiple of 7, but is close to a multiple of 7. In this case, the number of days off will be the number of days off in the last Martian week, which is 2.

### Step 3: Implement the solution
We can implement the solution using the following Python code:","import math

def min_max_days_off(n):
    # Calculate the minimum possible number of days off
    min_days_off = math.floor((n - 1) / 7) + 2

The task is to find the maximum number of chocolates that Little Joty can get by painting the tiles in a specific pattern.

The key observation here is that the number of chocolates Joty can get is determined by the number of tiles that are painted Red and Blue. 

Let's analyze the problem further:

- If a tile is painted Red, it means that its index is divisible by `a` but not by `b`. 
- If a tile is painted Blue, it means that its index is divisible by `b` but not by `a`. 
- If a tile is painted Red or Blue, it means that its index is divisible by either `a` or `b`, but not both.

Now, let's count the number of tiles that are painted Red, Blue, or both.

- The number of tiles that are painted Red is the number of multiples of `a` that are less than or equal to `n` but not multiples of `b`. This can be calculated as `n//a - n//(a*b)//a`.
- The number of tiles that are painted Blue is the number of multiples of `b` that are less than or equal to `n` but not multiples of `a`. This can be calculated as `n//b - n//(a*b)//b`.
- The number of tiles that are painted both Red and Blue is the number of multiples of `a*b` that are less than or equal to `n`. This can be calculated as `n//(a*b)`.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chocolates that Joty can get:

- The number of chocolates for Red tiles is `p * (n//a - n//(a*b)//a)`.
- The number of chocolates for Blue tiles is `q * (n//b - n//(a*b)//b)`.
- The number of chocolates for both Red and Blue tiles is `max(p, q) * n//(a*b)`.

The total number of chocolates that Joty can get is the sum of these three terms.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:","def max_chocolates(n, a, b, p, q):
    return p * (n//a - n//(a*b)//a) + q * (n//b - n//(a*b)//b) + max(p, q) * n//(a*b)

## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies that Vova can obtain by swapping at most one trophy.

## Step 2: Count the total number of golden trophies
We can start by counting the total number of golden trophies. This will give us the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies.

## Step 3: Find the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies without swapping
We can find the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies without swapping by finding the maximum number of consecutive golden trophies.

## Step 4: Find the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies with swapping
We can find the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies with swapping by considering the following cases:

* If there are more than two golden trophies, we can swap two golden trophies to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible.
* If there is only one golden trophy, we can swap it with a silver trophy to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible.

## Step 5: Return the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies
We can return the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies by comparing the results from steps 3 and 4.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:","def max_beauty(n, trophies):
    golden_trophies = trophies.count('G')

A permutation is stack-sortable if and only if it does not contain any decreasing subsequence of length 2 or more. This means that if we have a stack-sortable permutation, we can always find the next element to pop from the stack by finding the smallest element in the remaining permutation.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. First, we sort the given k elements of the permutation in descending order. This is because we want to maximize the lexicographically order of the permutation.

2. Then, we find the smallest element in the remaining permutation that is greater than the kth element. If we can't find such an element, it means that the given permutation is not stack-sortable and we print -1.

3. If we can find such an element, we add it to the permutation and remove it from the remaining permutation. We repeat this process until we have filled the permutation.

4. In each iteration, we add the smallest element in the remaining permutation that is greater than the last element in the permutation. This ensures that the permutation remains stack-sortable.

**Problem Statement:**
Nicholas has an array `a` that contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. He wants to perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.

**Step 1:** Understand the problem
Nicholas wants to swap two elements to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The distance between two elements is the absolute difference between their positions.

**Step 2:** Identify the constraints
The input array `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This means that the array is a permutation of size `n`.

**Step 3:** Find the position of the minimum and maximum elements
Let `min_pos` and `max_pos` be the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, respectively. We can find these positions by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum and maximum values.

**Step 4:** Calculate the maximum distance
The maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements is the maximum of the following two distances:

* `max_pos - min_pos`: This is the distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the original array.
* `n - (min_pos + max_pos)`: This is the distance between the minimum and maximum elements after swapping the element at `min_pos` with the element at `n - max_pos`.

**Step 5:** Return the maximum distance
The maximum distance is the maximum of the two distances calculated in Step 4.

Here's a Python function that implements these steps:","def max_distance(n, a):
    min_pos = a.index(min(a))
    max_pos = a.index(max(a))

    max_dist = max(max_pos - min_pos, n - (min_pos + max_pos))

    for i in range(n):
        if i != min_pos and a[i] == n - max_pos + 1:
            max_dist = max(max_dist, n - (min_pos + (n - max_pos + 1)))
        elif i != max_pos and a[i] == min_pos + 1:

We are given two numbers, m and x, where m is the number of rooms and x is the parameter of the x-mouse. We want to find the minimum number of traps that we need to place in the rooms to catch the x-mouse.

The x-mouse moves from room i to room i * x mod m. Since the GCD of x and m is 1, we can use the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to find the minimum number of traps.

Let's consider the rooms that the x-mouse can visit. Since the x-mouse moves from room i to room i * x mod m, we can see that the x-mouse will visit the same room multiple times. For example, if the x-mouse is in room 3, it will move to room 3 * 3 mod 4 = 1, then to room 1 * 3 mod 4 = 3, and so on.

We can use the fact that the LCM of two numbers a and b is equal to the product of a and b divided by their GCD. In this case, the LCM of m and x is equal to m * x / GCD(m, x).

Since the GCD of m and x is 1, the LCM of m and x is equal to m * x.

We can see that the x-mouse will visit the same room multiple times, and the number of times it visits each room is equal to the GCD of the room number and x.

Therefore, the minimum number of traps that we need to place is equal to the number of rooms that the x-mouse visits, which is equal to the LCM of m and x divided by the GCD of m and x.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:","import math

m, x = map(int, input().split())

g = gcd(m, x)

SyntaxError: unmatched ')'","### Solution to the Birthday Paradox Problem

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and the formula for the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday.

Let's denote the number of days in the year as `2^n` and the number of people to be interviewed as `k`. The probability that all `k` people have different birthdays is the probability that the first person has a unique birthday, multiplied by the probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person's), multiplied by the probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two people's), and so on.

This probability can be calculated as follows:

`P(unique birthdays) = (2^n - 1) / 2^n * (2^n - 2) / (2^n - 1) * ... * (2^n - k + 1) / (2^n - k + 2)`

However, calculating this product directly can be computationally expensive for large values of `n` and `k`. Instead, we can use the complementary counting principle to find the probability that at least two people share the same birthday.

The probability that at least two people share the same birthday is equal to 1 minus the probability that all people have unique birthdays:

`P(at least two people share the same birthday) = 1 - P(unique birthdays)`

To calculate `P(unique birthdays)`, we can use the formula for the product of a sequence of terms:

`P(unique birthdays) = (2^n - 1) / 2^n * (2^n - 2) / (2^n - 1) * ... * (2^n - k + 1) / (2^n - k + 2)`

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factors:

`P(unique birthdays) = (2^n - k) / 2^n`

Now, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share the same birthday:

`P(at least two people share the same birthday) = 1 - (2^n - k) / 2^n`

This expression can be further simplified:

`P(at least two people share the same birthday) = (k - 1) / 2^n + 1 / 2^n * (k choose 2)`

where `(k choose 2)` is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of `k` items","### Solution to the Birthday Paradox Problem

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the position of Limak to the North Pole.

2. Iterate through each movement in the description.

   - If Limak is at the North Pole and the movement is to the South, it is not a valid movement, so print ""NO"" and exit.

   - If the movement is to the North, update the position of Limak to the North Pole.
   - If the movement is to the South, update the position of Limak to the South Pole.
   - If the movement is to the East or West, update the position accordingly.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the number of times `a_1` and `a_2` can fit into the range `[L, R]`. This can be done by dividing `R` by `a_1` and `a_2`, and taking the floor of the result. This will give us the maximum number of times `a_1` and `a_2` can fit into the range.

2. Next, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a_1` and `a_2`. This can be done using the `math.gcd()` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_1` and `a_2`, and then dividing `a_1 * a_2` by the GCD.

3. Now, we need to find the number of times the LCM of `a_1` and `a_2` can fit into the range `[L, R]`. This can be done by dividing `R` by the LCM of `a_1` and `a_2`, and taking the floor of the result. This will give us the maximum number of times the LCM can fit into the range.

4. Finally, we need to subtract the number of times `a_1` and `a_2` can fit into the range from the number of times the LCM of `a_1` and `a_2` can fit into the range. This will give us the number of integers x such that L ≤ x ≤ R and x = a_1k' + b_1 = a_2l' + b_2, for some integers k', l' ≥ 0.

1. We are given two cakes, each cut into a certain number of pieces. The number of pieces in the first cake is 'a' and the number of pieces in the second cake is 'b'.
2. We also know that there will be 'n' people at the celebration, and each plate will be set for one person.
3. Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. In other words, he wants to find the maximum possible number 'x' such that he can distribute the cakes according to the given conditions, and each plate will contain at least 'x' pieces of cake.

Let's analyze the possible values of 'x':

* If 'x' is 1, then each plate will contain at least one piece of cake. However, this may not be possible if the total number of pieces is less than 'n'. For example, if 'n' is 5 and the total number of pieces is 3, then it's not possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate contains at least one piece.
* If 'x' is 2, then each plate will contain at least two pieces of cake. This may be possible if the total number of pieces is greater than or equal to 'n'. For example, if 'n' is 5 and the total number of pieces is 10, then it's possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate contains at least two pieces.

To find the maximum possible value of 'x', we can start from the maximum possible value and decrease it until we find a value that is possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. First, we read the dimensions of the flag (n x m) and the flag itself.

2. Then, we check if the flag has three colors ('R', 'G', and 'B') by using a set to store unique characters in the flag. If the size of the set is not 3, we can immediately return ""NO"".

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.

### Problem 1: Find the missing letter

The problem requires us to find the missing letter in a list of consecutive letters. We can use the following steps to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a variable `n` to 0.
2. Use a while loop to iterate through the list of letters.
3. Inside the loop, check if the ASCII value of the current letter is equal to the ASCII value of the next letter minus 1. If this condition is true, increment `n`.
4. Once the loop ends, the missing letter is `chr(1+ord(chars[n]))`.

Here's the Python code for this problem:","def find_missing_letter(chars):
    n = 0

We want to find the minimum time for Vasiliy to reach the post office. There are two options:

1. Drive the car for a certain distance, then walk the rest of the way.
2. Walk the entire distance.

Let's consider the first option. Vasiliy drives the car for a distance of `x` kilometers, then walks the remaining distance of `d - x` kilometers. The time taken to drive `x` kilometers is `x * a` seconds, and the time taken to walk `d - x` kilometers is `(d - x) * b` seconds.

To minimize the total time, we need to find the optimal value of `x`. We can use the fact that the car breaks every `k` kilometers. If Vasiliy drives for `k` kilometers, he will need to repair the car for `t` seconds.

Let's consider the following cases:

* If `x` is a multiple of `k`, then Vasiliy will drive for `x` kilometers, repair the car for `t` seconds, and then drive for another `x` kilometers. The total time taken is `2 * x * a + t` seconds.
* If `x` is not a multiple of `k`, then Vasiliy will drive for `x` kilometers, repair the car for `t` seconds, and then walk the remaining distance of `d - x` kilometers. The total time taken is `x * a + t + (d - x) * b` seconds.

To find the minimum time, we need to compare the times taken in both cases. We can use the fact that `x * a + t + (d - x) * b` is a quadratic function of `x`. We can find the minimum value of this function by using the fact that the minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at its vertex.

Let's find the vertex of the quadratic function:","def find_vertex(d, k, a, b, t):
    # Calculate the coefficient of the quadratic function
    c = b - a
    
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex

The problem is asking us to find the minimum cost of additional cabling required to ensure that disruption of services at any one city will still leave the rest of the country connected.

Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. We are given a matrix `l` representing the cost of laying fiber optic cables between every pair of cities.
2. We initialize a list `d` of size `n` with infinite values, except for `d[1]` which is set to 0. This list will store the minimum cost of connecting each city to the rest of the country.
3. We initialize a set `q` with all cities except the capital city (city 1).
4. We define a function `extract` that returns the city with the minimum cost in `q`.
5. We iterate over the cities in `q` and for each city, we update its cost in `d` if a cheaper path is found through the current city.
6. We repeat step 5 until all cities in `q` have been processed.
7. The final answer is the sum of the costs in `d` excluding the cost of the capital city.

**Problem 1: Clean Mean**

The problem is to remove outliers from a sample of data and return the mean of the cleaned sample. An outlier is a data point that is more than a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean.

1. First, calculate the mean of the sample using the formula: `mean = sum(sample) / len(sample)`.
2. Next, calculate the standard deviation of the sample using the formula: `dev = sqrt((1/len(sample)) * sum((num - mean)**2 for num in sample))`.
3. Then, create a new list `cleaned` that only includes data points that are within `cutoff` standard deviations of the mean.
4. If the original sample and the cleaned sample are the same, return the mean of the original sample. Otherwise, recursively call the `clean_mean` function on the cleaned sample and return the result.
5. Finally, round the result to two decimal places using the `round` function.

Here's the solution:","def clean_mean(sample, cutoff):
    mean = sum(sample)/len(sample)
    dev = ((1/len(sample))*sum((num-mean)**2 for num in sample))**(1/2)

SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)","To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps.

1.  **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a string `s` of length `n` (even) and a list of integers `b` representing the beauty of each index in `s`. We need to find the maximum possible beauty of an antipalindromic permutation of `s`.

2.  **Defining an Antipalindromic String:** An antipalindromic string `t` is a permutation of `s` such that `t[i] != t[n - i + 1]` for all `1 <= i <= n/2`. This means that the first and last characters are different, the second and second-to-last characters are different, and so on.

3.  **Approach:** To maximize the beauty of `t`, we want to keep the characters with the highest beauty in the middle of the string. This is because the characters in the middle of the string will be used twice in the antipalindromic string `t` (e.g., `t[i]` and `t[n - i + 1]`).

4.  **Implementation:**

    *   First, we create a list of tuples `pairs` where each tuple contains a character from `s` and its corresponding beauty from `b`.
    *   We sort the `pairs` list in descending order based on the beauty.
    *   We create two lists `left` and `right` to store the characters that will be placed at the left and right ends of the antipalindromic string `t`.
    *   We iterate over the `pairs` list, and for each character, we add it to either the `left` or `right` list based on whether its beauty is greater than the beauty of the corresponding character in the `right` list.
    *   Finally, we calculate the maximum possible beauty of `t` by summing up the beauty of the characters in the `left` and `right` lists.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def maxBeauty(n, s, b):
    pairs = sorted(zip(s, b), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

Level 2: 2 glasses (second level)

Now, let's consider the glasses at each level. At each level, the glasses are filled at a rate of 1 glass per second. We can calculate the number of glasses that are filled at each level by dividing the time t by the number of glasses at that level.

For example, at level 1, there is 1 glass, so if t is 1, 2, 3, ... seconds, then 1, 0, 0, ... glasses will be filled.

Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).

0062,random_few_shot_cot,ERROR,Timeout on test 1,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the game's rules and the optimal strategy for both players. 

The game is a variant of the ""Nim game"". In the Nim game, players take turns removing objects from a pile. The key to winning the game is to always leave the opponent with a pile that is a multiple of a certain number (usually 2, 4, or 8, depending on the number of piles). This is known as the ""Nim-sum"" of the piles.

In this game, the players can either remove objects from a single pile or decrease all piles by the same amount. 

To determine who wins, we need to find the Nim-sum of the piles. If the Nim-sum is 0, it means that the piles are already a multiple of the base number (in this case, it's 2). In this case, BitAryo can always win by decreasing all piles by 1. 

However, if the Nim-sum is not 0, we need to find the base number (usually the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the Nim-sum). If the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the Nim-sum is odd, then BitLGM can win. Otherwise, BitAryo can win.

Here is the solution in Python:","def determine_winner(n, a):

**Problem 1: N Queens Puzzle**

The problem is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no queen can attack another. The queens are represented by 'Q' on the board, and empty spaces are represented by '|'.

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The idea is to place the first queen on the board and then try to place the next queens one by one. If we find a valid position for the next queen, we continue with the next queen. If we cannot find a valid position for the next queen, we backtrack and try a different position for the previous queen.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1.  Initialize an empty board with N rows and N columns.
2.  Place the first queen on the board. We can choose any position for the first queen.
3.  For each subsequent queen, try to place it on the board such that it does not attack any previously placed queen. We can use a helper function `is_safe` to check if a position is safe for the queen.
4.  If we find a valid position for the queen, we continue with the next queen.
5.  If we cannot find a valid position for the queen, we backtrack and try a different position for the previous queen.
6.  If we have placed all queens on the board, we have found a solution. We can return the positions of the queens as an array.
7.  If we have exhausted all possible positions for the queens and still cannot find a solution, we return an empty array.

Let's analyze the situation when Willman and Bolt can tie. This happens when both of them can cover the same distance L without falling into the abyss. We can write this as:

L = k1w + k2b

where k1 and k2 are non-negative integers representing the number of steps taken by Willman and Bolt respectively.

We want to find the number of values of L for which this equation holds. We can rewrite the equation as:

k1w = L - k2b

Since k1 and k2 are non-negative integers, we need to find the number of values of L for which (L - k2b) is a multiple of w.

We can use the fact that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and b is 1 (since w and b are relatively prime). This means that for every value of L, there is at most one value of k1 for which (L - k2b) is a multiple of w.

Now, let's consider the values of L for which (L - k2b) is a multiple of w. We can write this as:

(L - k2b) = mw

where m is a non-negative integer.

We can rewrite this as:

L = mw + k2b

Since L is an integer, we know that mw + k2b is an integer. We can use the fact that the gcd of w and b is 1 to show that m is unique for every value of L.

Therefore, the number of values of L for which (L - k2b) is a multiple of w is equal to the number of values of m for which mw + k2b is an integer.

We can use the fact that the gcd of w and b is 1 to show that mw + k2b is an integer if and only if m is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of w and L.

mw + k2b = mg + k2b

1.  Initialize two arrays, `sx` and `sy`, of size `n + 1` to store the x and y coordinates after performing each operation.
2.  Initialize `x` and `y` to 0.
3.  Iterate over the sequence of operations and update `sx` and `sy` accordingly.
4.  Initialize two arrays, `mxx` and `mxy`, of size `n + 1` to store the maximum x and y coordinates that can be reached at each position.
5.  Initialize `mxx[0]` and `mxy[0]` to 0.
6.  Iterate over the sequence of operations and update `mxx` and `mxy` accordingly.

10. Iterate over the sequence of operations in reverse order and update `mxx`, `mxy`, `mxmxx`, and `mxmxy` accordingly.
11. If the final `mxx` and `mxy` are not equal to `x` and `y`, it means that it's impossible to reach the cell `(x, y)`, so return -1.

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

We are given the initial number of commentary boxes $n$, the number of delegations $m$, the cost to build a box $a$, and the cost to demolish a box $b$. We need to find the minimum amount of burles the organizers should pay to make the number of commentary boxes divisible by $m$.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the remainder of $n$ divided by $m$, which represents the number of boxes that need to be added or removed to make the total number of boxes divisible by $m$.
2. If the remainder is $0$, it means that the number of boxes is already divisible by $m$, and the organizers do not need to pay anything.
3. If the remainder is not $0$, we need to calculate the minimum cost to add or remove boxes to make the total number of boxes divisible by $m$.

To calculate the minimum cost, we can use the following formula:

Cost = min(a * (n + k * m) % m, b * (n - k * m) % m)

where $k$ is the number of boxes that need to be added or removed.

We can iterate through all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $n // m$ and calculate the cost using the formula above. The minimum cost will be the smallest value we find.

1.  We are given a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` of length `n`.
2.  We need to find a subsequence whose sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences.
3.  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

*   Initialize two variables, `max_odd_sum` and `max_even_sum`, to store the maximum odd sum and maximum even sum respectively.
*   Initialize two variables, `odd_sum` and `even_sum`, to store the current odd sum and even sum respectively.
*   Iterate through the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}`.
*   For each element `a_i` in the sequence:
    *   If `a_i` is odd, add it to `odd_sum` and update `max_odd_sum` if `odd_sum` is greater than `max_odd_sum`.
    *   If `a_i` is even, add it to `even_sum` and update `max_even_sum` if `even_sum` is greater than `max_even_sum`.
*   After iterating through the entire sequence, the maximum odd sum is stored in `max_odd_sum`, which is the answer.

Given x and y as the GCD and LCM, we need to find the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. 

We can iterate over all possible values of a and b in the given range and check if they satisfy the condition GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y. 

However, this approach is inefficient as it requires calculating the GCD and LCM for each pair of integers. 

A better approach is to first find the possible values of a and b that satisfy the condition GCD(a, b) = x. We can find these values by finding the multiples of x in the range [l, r]. 

For each multiple of x, we can find the corresponding value of b such that LCM(a, b) = y. 

Since the LCM of two numbers a and b is equal to the product of a and b divided by their GCD, we can write the equation LCM(a, b) = y as a * b / x = y. 

Solving for b, we get b = (y * x) / a. 

We can then check if the calculated value of b is within the range [l, r] and if it is a multiple of x. If both conditions are met, we increment the count of good pairs.

So, we need to find the smallest $k$ such that $\frac{(a+k)(b+k)}{\gcd(a+k,b+k)}$ is minimized.

We can start by finding the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$. If $\gcd(a,b)$ is not 1, then the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is not 1, and we can choose $k = 0$.

If $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, then the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is $ab$, and we need to find the smallest $k$ such that $\frac{(a+k)(b+k)}{k}$ is minimized.

**Problem 1: Matrix Block Sum**

The problem is to calculate the sum of all elements in a matrix `mat` within a window of size `K x K` centered at each position `(i, j)`.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1.  Calculate the cumulative sum of each row in the matrix `mat`. This can be done by iterating over each row and column, and keeping track of the cumulative sum of each row.
2.  For each position `(i, j)` in the matrix, calculate the sum of the elements within the window of size `K x K` centered at `(i, j)`. This can be done by subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements that are outside the window from the cumulative sum of the elements within the window.
3.  Return the sum of all elements within the window for each position `(i, j)`.

Here's the Python code for the solution:","def matrixBlockSum(mat, K):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    cum = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

We know that a week consists of 7 days, and each row in the calendar corresponds to a weekday. The first date of the month can be any day of the week, from Monday (1) to Sunday (7).

To find the number of columns, we need to find the remainder when the number of days in the month is divided by 7. This is because each week has 7 days, and the remainder will tell us how many days are left over and need to be placed in a new column.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Determine the number of days in the month. This can be done using the following rules:
   - For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), the number of days is 31.
   - For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), the number of days is 30.
   - For months with 28 days (February in a non-leap year), the number of days is 28.

2. Determine the first day of the month. This can be done by converting the input day (1-7) to the corresponding day of the week (Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, ..., Sunday is 7).

3. Calculate the number of days that have passed before the first day of the month. This can be done by subtracting the first day from 1 (since Monday is 1).

4. Subtract the number of days passed from the total number of days in the month to get the number of days that are part of the current week.

5. Divide the number of days in the current week by 7 to get the number of complete weeks.

6. Multiply the number of complete weeks by 7 to get the total number of days that have been placed in columns.

7. Subtract the total number of days placed in columns from the total number of days in the month to get the remainder.

8. If the remainder is 0, then the table can fit into the current number of columns. Otherwise, we need to add an extra column for the remainder.

Here's the solution in Python:
```python
def calendar_columns(m, d):
    # Determine the number of days in the month

Let's consider the binary representation of the numbers in the given interval. We can represent a number as a sequence of bits, where each bit is either 0 or 1.

For a number to have exactly one zero in its binary representation, it must be of the form:

*   $a_0a_1...a_{k-1}0a_{k+1}...a_n$ (where $a_i$ are bits and $k$ is the position of the zero)

Let's consider the numbers in the given interval $[a,b]$.

We can find the range of numbers with exactly one zero in their binary representation by finding the range of numbers with $n$ bits, where the most significant bit is 0.

We can use the following logic:

The problem asks us to find the minimal number of layers required to draw segments on a coordinate axis with endpoints at integer points between 0 and N, inclusive. We can start by analyzing the problem and looking for patterns.

For N = 1, there is only one segment, so we need one layer.

For N = 2, we have two segments: [0, 1] and [0, 2]. We can draw them in two layers: [0, 1] in the first layer and [0, 2] in the second layer.

For N = 3, we have three segments: [0, 1], [0, 2], and [0, 3]. We can draw them in four layers: [0, 1], [0, 2], and [0, 3] in the first three layers, and [0, 3] in the fourth layer.

For N = 4, we have four segments: [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], and [0, 4]. We can draw them in six layers: [0, 1], [0, 2], and [0, 3] in the first three layers, [0, 3] and [0, 4] in the fourth layer, and [0, 4] in the fifth and sixth layers.

From these examples, we can see that the number of layers required to draw the segments is related to the number of segments and the position of the endpoints.

Let's analyze the problem further. We can see that the number of segments is equal to the number of integer points between 0 and N, inclusive, which is N + 1. We can also see that the number of layers required to draw the segments is equal to the number of times we need to add a new segment to the existing layers.

We can use the following formula to calculate the minimal number of layers required to draw the segments:

1 + ∑[i = 1 to N] i

This formula calculates the sum of the first N positive integers, which is equal to the number of layers required to draw the segments.

We can simplify the formula using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

3. Recognize the relationship between base-n numbers and the decimal system: A number in base-n is a sum of multiples of powers of n. For example, in base-16, 11311 is equal to 1*16^4 + 3*16^3 + 1*16^2 + 1*16^1 + 1*16^0.

4. Develop an algorithm:
   - Initialize the result as 0.
   - Iterate over the digits of k from right to left (i.e., from the least significant digit to the most significant digit).
   - For each digit, multiply the current result by n and add the decimal value of the digit (which is its value in base-10).
   - The final result is the minimum decimal number that, when converted to base-n, results in k.

5. Write the code:","def solve(n, k):
    result = 0
    k = k[::-1]  # Reverse the string k to iterate over its digits from right to left
    for digit in k:
        result = result * n + int(digit)
    return result

# Test cases
n = int(input())
k = input()
print(solve(n, k))

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach with some optimizations.

We'll start by generating a list of all values that can be obtained by repeatedly applying the function `f` to a number. We'll store these values in a set to avoid duplicates.

Next, we'll iterate through the numbers from `n` to `1` and for each number, we'll check if it's in the set of values. If it is, we'll increment the count of numbers that lead to this value. We'll also keep track of the maximum value that is contained in at least `k` paths.

To solve this problem, we need to understand how the ball moves on the billiard table. Since the ball can only move along lines that are parallel to the axes or that make a $45^{\circ}$ angle with them, we can consider the four possible directions in which the ball can move:

1. Right (R)
2. Left (L)
3. Up (U)
4. Down (D)
5. Diagonal Down-Right (DR)
6. Diagonal Down-Left (DL)
7. Diagonal Up-Right (UR)
8. Diagonal Up-Left (UL)

We can simulate the movement of the ball by applying these directions to the ball's position and speed. We need to keep track of the ball's position and speed at each step.

The ball will eventually fall into a pocket if it reaches a position where its coordinates coincide with one of the pockets. The pockets are located at the following coordinates:

* Top-left pocket: (0, 0)
* Top-right pocket: (n, 0)
* Bottom-left pocket: (0, m)
* Bottom-right pocket: (n, m)

We can use a loop to simulate the movement of the ball until it falls into a pocket or reaches a position where it will never fall into a pocket.

The problem is asking us to determine whether it's possible to place two paintings of different sizes on a rectangular board. The board has dimensions `a_1` by `b_1`, and the two paintings have dimensions `a_2` by `b_2` and `a_3` by `b_3`.

We need to check if the board is large enough to accommodate both paintings, taking into account their dimensions and the fact that they can touch each other and the edges of the board, but cannot overlap or go beyond the edge of the board.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Read the dimensions of the board (`a_1` and `b_1`) and the dimensions of the two paintings (`a_2`, `b_2`, `a_3`, and `b_3`).
2. Check if the board is large enough to accommodate both paintings by checking the following conditions:
	* `a_1` must be greater than or equal to the maximum of `a_2` and `a_3`.
	* `b_1` must be greater than or equal to the sum of `b_2` and `b_3`.
3. If the board meets the conditions above, print ""YES"". Otherwise, print ""NO"".

**Problem 1: Reversi**

The problem is to implement a function that simulates a single row of the Reversi game. The function takes an array of moves as input and returns a string representing the final state of the board.

**Solution**

The solution is to iterate over the moves and update the board accordingly. We use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each move. For each move, we check if there are any opponent's pieces that can be flipped by sandwiching them between the current piece and another piece of the same color. We use regular expressions to find the opponent's pieces that can be flipped. If we find any, we flip them by replacing them with the current piece's color.

Here is the code:","import re

Initially Zmei Gorynich has $x$ heads. You can deal $n$ types of blows. If you deal a blow of the $i$-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by $min(d_i, curX)$, there $curX$ is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows $h_i$ new heads. If $curX = 0$ then Gorynich is defeated. 

You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.

For example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.

Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.

The following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th blow.

For example, if $curX = 10$, $d = 7$, $h = 10$ then the number of heads changes to $13$ (you cut $7$ heads off, but then Zmei grows $10$ new ones), but if $curX = 10$, $d = 11$, $h = 100$ then number of heads changes to $0$ and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.

Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.

The following $n$ lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The $i$-th line contains two integers $d_i$ and $h_i$ ($1 \le d_i, h_i \le 10^9$) — the description of the $i$-th blow.


-----Output-----

For each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. 

If Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print $-1$.

1. First, let's understand the pattern of standing spectators at different times. From the examples, we can see that the number of standing spectators at time `t` is the minimum of `t` and `n - (t - k)`.

2. Now, we can write a function to calculate the number of standing spectators at time `t`. We can use the formula `min(t, n - (t - k))`.

3. Here's the code in Python to solve the problem:","n, k, t = map(int, input().split())

AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'pop'","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the moves that Petya can make and how they affect the strings s, t, and u.

Let's denote the moves as follows:

* Move 1: Extract the first character of s and append it to t.
* Move 2: Extract the last character of t and append it to u.

We can observe that if the last character of t is smaller than the first character of s, it is better to make Move 2. Otherwise, it is better to make Move 1.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty string u and an empty string t.
2. Iterate over the characters of the input string s from left to right.
3. For each character, compare it with the last character of t. If the character is smaller than the last character of t, make Move 2. Otherwise, make Move 1.
4. After making a move, update the strings s, t, and u accordingly.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the string s is empty.
6. The resulting string u is the final answer.

Here is the code:","s = input()
t = """"
u = """"

2.  Check if the current time is already a palindrome. If it is, return 0.
3.  If the current time is not a palindrome, we need to find the next palindrome time.
4.  To find the next palindrome time, we can start from the current time and increment the minute by 1. If the time is not a palindrome, we continue incrementing the minute until we find a palindrome.
5.  Once we find the next palindrome time, we can calculate the difference between the current time and the next palindrome time in minutes.

0021,auto_few_shot_cot,PASS,All 159 tests passed,"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements by performing exactly one swap.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: First, we read the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
2. Initialize variables: We initialize two variables `max_dist` and `min_dist` to store the maximum and minimum possible distances, respectively.
3. Check if the array is already sorted: If the array is already sorted, we can simply return `n - 1` as the maximum possible distance.
4. Find the position of the minimum and maximum elements: We find the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
5. Try swapping the minimum and maximum elements: We try swapping the minimum and maximum elements and calculate the new distances.
6. Update the maximum and minimum distances: We update `max_dist` and `min_dist` with the new distances.
7. Repeat steps 4-6: We repeat steps 4-6 for all possible pairs of elements in the array.
8. Return the maximum distance: Finally, we return `max_dist` as the maximum possible distance.

Here's the code:","def max_distance(n, a):
    max_dist = 0
    min_dist = n - 1

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to fill a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns with `k` ones in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal and is lexicographically maximal.

### Step 1: Understand the problem constraints

* The matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal.
* The matrix is filled with zeroes initially.
* The number of ones to be filled is `k`.
* The matrix has `n` rows and `n` columns.
* The matrix is lexicographically maximal.

### Step 2: Identify the key insights

* Since the matrix is symmetrical, we can focus on filling the upper triangle of the matrix.
* The maximum value in the upper triangle will be `k` if we start from the top-left corner.
* We need to place the ones in a way that the resulting matrix is lexicographically maximal.

### Step 3: Develop a strategy

* We can start by filling the top-left corner with `k` ones.
* Then, we can fill the next row with `k - 1` ones, and so on.
* We need to make sure that the matrix remains symmetrical after each step.

### Step 4: Implement the solution

SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 5)","### Problem 1: Catching the X-Mouse

We need to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse in the campus.

Let's analyze the problem:

* The x-mouse moves from room $i$ to room $i \cdot x \mod{m}$.
* We need to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse.
* The GCD of $x$ and $m$ is 1, which means that $x$ and $m$ are coprime.

We can use the fact that the x-mouse will visit all rooms if it starts in any of the rooms that are not multiples of the GCD of $x$ and $m$. Since the GCD of $x$ and $m$ is 1, this means that the x-mouse will visit all rooms if it starts in any of the rooms.

However, we need to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse. This can be done by finding the period of the x-mouse's movement, which is the smallest number of steps after which the x-mouse returns to the starting room.

The period of the x-mouse's movement can be found using the formula:

`period = gcd(m, lcm(m, x))`

where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor and `lcm` is the least common multiple.

However, since `x` and `m` are coprime, we can simplify the formula to:

`period = m`

This is because the x-mouse will visit all rooms in `m` steps.

Now, we can find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse by dividing the number of rooms by the period and taking the ceiling of the result:

`min_traps = ceil(m / period)`

However, this is not the correct solution because it does not take into account the fact that the x-mouse can start in any of the rooms.

The correct solution is to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse for each starting room, and then take the maximum of these values.

We can do this by iterating over each starting room and finding the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse for that room.

The minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse for a given starting room can be found by iterating over each room and checking if the x-mouse will visit that room.

If the x-mouse will visit a room","### Problem 1: Catching the X-Mouse

We need to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse in the campus.

Let's analyze the problem:

* The x-mouse moves from room $i$ to room $i \cdot x \mod{m}$.
* We need to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse.
* The GCD of $x$ and $m$ is 1, which means that $x$ and $m$ are coprime.

We can use the fact that the x-mouse will visit all rooms if it starts in any of the rooms that are not multiples of the GCD of $x$ and $m$. Since the GCD of $x$ and $m$ is 1, this means that the x-mouse will visit all rooms if it starts in any of the rooms.

However, we need to find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse. This can be done by finding the period of the x-mouse's movement, which is the smallest number of steps after which the x-mouse returns to the starting room.

The period of the x-mouse's movement can be found using the formula:

`period = gcd(m, lcm(m, x))`

where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor and `lcm` is the least common multiple.

However, since `x` and `m` are coprime, we can simplify the formula to:

`period = m`

This is because the x-mouse will visit all rooms in `m` steps.

Now, we can find the minimum number of traps required to catch the x-mouse by dividing the number of rooms by the period and taking the ceiling of the result:

`min_traps = ceil(m / period)`

However, this is not the correct solution because it does not take into account the fact that the x-mouse can start in any of the rooms.

**Ayrat's Spiral**

We are given an integer `n`, representing the number of moves Ayrat has made. We need to find his current coordinates `(x, y)` after `n` moves.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

Ayrat is moving in a spiral pattern, where each move consists of a sequence of two moves: a move to the right and a move up. The spiral pattern can be represented as a sequence of coordinates `(x, y)`, where each coordinate is obtained by adding 1 to the current `x` and adding 1 to the current `y` for each right move, and adding 1 to the current `y` for each up move.

**Step 2: Find the pattern**

Let's analyze the pattern of the spiral:

*   For each right move, `x` increases by 1 and `y` remains the same.
*   For each up move, `x` remains the same and `y` increases by 1.
*   The number of right moves is equal to the number of up moves.

We can use this pattern to derive a formula for the coordinates `(x, y)` after `n` moves.

**Step 3: Derive the formula**

Let's denote the number of right moves as `r` and the number of up moves as `u`. We know that `r = u`, so we can use `u` as the variable to calculate the coordinates.

We can calculate `u` as follows:

`u = floor(sqrt(2 * n))`

`floor` is used to round down to the nearest integer, because `u` must be an integer.

Now, we can calculate `x` and `y` as follows:

`x = u + floor((u + 1) / 2) * floor(sqrt(2 * n) - 1)`

`y = floor(sqrt(2 * n) - 1) / 2`

**Step 4: Implement the solution**

Here's the Python code to implement the solution:

```python
import math

def ayrat_spiral(n):
    u = math.floor(math.sqrt(2 * n))
    x = u + math.floor((u + 1) / 2) * math.floor(math.sqrt(2 * n) - 1)

To solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach by generating all possible substrings of the given string and checking if they are palindromes. If we find a non-palindrome substring, we can return its length. If no non-palindrome substring is found, the answer is 0.

### Code Solution

Here is a Python code that implements the above approach:","def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            if substring != substring[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substring))
    return max_len

# Test the function
print(longest_non_palindrome(""mew""))  # Output: 3
print(longest_non_palindrome(""wuffuw""))  # Output: 5
print(longest_non_palindrome(""qqqqqqqq""))  # Output: 0

**Problem:** Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.

**Step 1:** We need to find the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the condition (x + y) % 5 == 0.

**Step 2:** To solve this problem, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. We know that (x + y) % 5 == 0 if and only if (x % 5 + y % 5) % 5 == 0.

**Step 3:** We can divide the numbers from 1 to n and 1 to m into 5 groups based on their remainders when divided by 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

**Step 4:** Let's consider the number of pairs (x, y) such that x % 5 == i and y % 5 == j. We can calculate the number of such pairs using the formula:

pairs(i, j) = min(n // 5 * m // 5, min(n // 5, m // 5))

**Step 5:** We need to sum up the number of pairs for all possible combinations of i and j.

**Step 6:** We can use a loop to iterate over all possible combinations of i and j, calculate the number of pairs using the formula in step 4, and add it to the total count.

**Step 7:** Finally, we return the total count as the result.

**Problem 1: Folding a Cube**

The problem requires us to determine if a given net can be folded into a cube. We are given a list of numbers representing the net, and we need to check if it can be folded into a cube.

The solution involves using a recursive function `expand` to try to expand the net in all possible directions. The function takes the current value, the remaining numbers, and the current x, y, and z coordinates as arguments.

1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. The output should be the lexicographically largest sequence.

   - We need to subtract this maximum power of 2 from n to get a new value.
   - We need to repeat this process until we have k numbers or n becomes 0.

The problem can be solved by simulating the process of filling the glasses. The key observation is that each glass can be filled independently, and the only constraint is that the glass below it must have a certain amount of champagne before the glass above it can be filled.

Let's denote the number of completely full glasses after t seconds as f(t). We can calculate f(t) by simulating the process of filling the glasses.

The base case is when t = 0. In this case, f(0) = 1, because only the top glass is filled.

For t > 0, we can simulate the process of filling the glasses by iterating from the top to the bottom. For each level i, we can calculate the number of completely full glasses on that level by dividing the total amount of champagne that has been poured onto that level by the number of glasses on that level.

We need to find the minimal number of wooden bars that can be used to make the frames for two doors. Each frame has two vertical sides of length `a` and one top side of length `b`. We are given the length of each wooden bar `n`, the length of the vertical sides `a`, and the length of the top side `b`.

**Step 2: Break down the problem**

To find the minimal number of wooden bars, we need to consider the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors, which is `2(2a + b)`. We can use a wooden bar to make one or more of these sides, depending on the length of the bar.

**Step 3: Determine the number of wooden bars needed**

We can determine the number of wooden bars needed by dividing the total length of all six sides by the length of each wooden bar. However, we need to consider the case where the length of the top side `b` is greater than the length of the vertical sides `a`. In this case, we may need to use multiple wooden bars to make the top side.

### Problem 1: Comparing Numbers in Different Bases

We are given two numbers, X and Y, represented in different bases. We need to compare these two numbers.

To solve this problem, we can first convert both numbers to base 10 (decimal system) and then compare them.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line contains two space-separated integers, `n` and `b_x`, where `n` is the number of digits in the `b_x`-based representation of X, and `b_x` is the base of X. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers, `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n`, which are the digits of X.
2. Convert X to base 10: We can convert X to base 10 using the formula:

   `X_10 = x_n * b_x^(n-1) + x_(n-1) * b_x^(n-2) + ... + x_1 * b_x^0`

   where `x_i` is the `i`-th digit of X, and `b_x` is the base of X.
3. Read the input for Y: The third line contains two space-separated integers, `m` and `b_y`, where `m` is the number of digits in the `b_y`-based representation of Y, and `b_y` is the base of Y. The fourth line contains `m` space-separated integers, `y_1`, `y_2`, ..., `y_m`, which are the digits of Y.
4. Convert Y to base 10: We can convert Y to base 10 using the same formula as in step 2, but with the digits of Y and the base `b_y`.
5. Compare X and Y: Once we have converted both numbers to base 10, we can compare them. If `X_10 < Y_10`, then X < Y. If `X_10 > Y_10`, then X > Y. If `X_10 = Y_10`, then X = Y.

Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def compare_numbers():

-6","Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given a number `n` and a value `k`. We want to remove the minimum number of digits from `n` so that the result is divisible by `10^k`.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Convert the number `n` to a string to easily access and manipulate its digits.
2. Find the last `k` digits of `n`. If `n` is less than `10^k`, return `k - len(n)`, because we need to add `k - len(n)` zeros to the end of `n` to make it divisible by `10^k`.
3. If the last `k` digits of `n` are divisible by `10^k`, return 0, because no digits need to be removed.
4. Otherwise, find the largest digit `d` in the last `k` digits of `n` such that `10^k` is divisible by `10^(k - d)`. This means we need to remove `d` digits from the end of `n`.
5. Return `d`.

Here is the Python code for the above approach:","def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    n_str = str(n)
    k_digits = n_str[-k:]
    if int(k_digits) % (10 ** k) == 0:
        return 0
    else:

            if int(k_digits[-d:]) % (10 ** (k - d)) == 0:
                return d
        return k - len(n_str)

### Problem 1: Remove Nth Node From End of List

The problem is to remove the Nth node from the end of a linked list. We need to find a way to traverse the list and remove the Nth node from the end in one pass.

Here's a step-by-step solution to this problem:

1. Create a dummy node and set its next pointer to the head of the list.
2. Initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, to the dummy node.
3. Move p1 N steps forward.
4. Move both p1 and p2 one step at a time until p1 reaches the end of the list.
5. At this point, p2 will be N steps behind p1, which is the Nth node from the end.
6. Remove the node pointed by p2 by setting its next pointer to the node after it.

Here's the Python code for this solution:","class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We have a rectangular checkered field of `n × m` size, where each cell can be either empty (""."") or occupied by a wall (""*""). We have one bomb that can be placed in any cell and will wipe out all walls in the row and column where it's placed.

### Step 2: Identify the Goal

The goal is to determine if it's possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb.

### Step 3: Think About the Conditions for Success

For the bomb to be effective, it needs to be placed in a way that the walls in at least one row and one column are completely wiped out. This means that if there's a row or a column with no walls, the bomb can be placed in an empty cell in that row or column and it will be effective.

### Step 4: Consider the Worst-Case Scenario

If there's no row or column with no walls, the bomb needs to be placed in a cell where it will wipe out the most walls. This can be achieved if the bomb is placed in a cell where the number of walls in the row and column is maximum.

### Step 5: Find a Solution

To find a solution, we can iterate over each cell in the depot and keep track of the number of walls in each row and column. If we find a cell where the number of walls in the row and column is maximum, we can place the bomb there.

However, there's a catch. The problem statement doesn't specify whether the bomb can be placed in a cell occupied by a wall or not. But if we think about it, placing the bomb in a cell occupied by a wall will wipe out the wall in that cell and all the walls in the row and column, which is exactly what we want.

### Step 6: Write the Code

Here's a Python solution that implements the above steps:

**Problem Analysis**

We are given a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and we need to find a subsequence with odd sum and maximum sum among all such subsequences. The subsequence is derived from the original sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Key Observations**

1. The sum of the subsequence must be odd.
2. We can either include or exclude each element in the subsequence.
3. If an element is included, its value is added to the sum of the subsequence.
4. If an element is excluded, its value is not added to the sum of the subsequence.

**Approach**

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can maintain two arrays, `odd` and `even`, where `odd[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i` with an odd sum, and `even[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i` with an even sum.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize `odd` and `even` arrays with zeros.
2. Iterate through the sequence from left to right.
3. For each element `a_i`, consider two cases:
	* If `a_i` is odd, we can either include it in the subsequence with an odd sum by adding `a_i` to `odd[i-1]`, or exclude it and keep the previous subsequence with an odd sum unchanged.
	* If `a_i` is even, we can either include it in the subsequence with an even sum by adding `a_i` to `even[i-1]`, or exclude it and keep the previous subsequence with an even sum unchanged.
4. Update `odd[i]` and `even[i]` accordingly based on the above cases.
5. After iterating through the entire sequence, the maximum sum of a subsequence with an odd sum is stored in `odd[n-1]`.

The problem is asking to find the expected length of the array `a` that Vivek generates using the given algorithm. The algorithm involves selecting a random integer `x` uniformly in the range from 1 to `m`, appending it to the end of `a`, and computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in `a`. If the GCD is 1, the algorithm stops; otherwise, it continues.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of expected value and the properties of GCD. Let's analyze the situation:

1.  The GCD of the first `i` integers in `a` is 1 if and only if none of these integers is divisible by any prime number greater than 1.
2.  If the GCD of the first `i` integers is 1, then the GCD of the first `i + 1` integers is also 1 if and only if the `i + 1`th integer is not divisible by any prime number greater than 1.

Based on this analysis, we can define a recursive function `f(m)` to compute the expected length of `a`. The function `f(m)` represents the expected length of `a` when the algorithm starts with `m` integers.","def f(m):

3.  We can use a loop to iterate over all numbers from `l` to `r` and check if the GCD of the number and `y/x` is `x`. If it is, then we increment the count of good pairs.

If the rounded-up average mark is less than k, we need to add more marks to increase the average mark. We can do this by adding k to the total sum and incrementing the number of marks by 1.

1.  Understand the problem: The problem involves checking whether it's possible to achieve a given array `a` using the described algorithm on an array `v` of zeros. The algorithm allows increasing the value at a position `pos` by `k^i` on each step.

2.  Break down the problem: To achieve an array `a` using the algorithm, we must be able to satisfy the following condition for each position `i`: `a_i <= v_i <= a_i + (k^i - 1)`. This condition ensures that the value at position `i` in array `a` is within the valid range of values that can be achieved by the algorithm.

3.  Develop the solution:

    *   Initialize a variable `canAchieve` to `True`, which will be used to track whether the array `a` can be achieved using the algorithm.

    *   Iterate over the positions in the array from 0 to `n - 1`.

    *   For each position `i`, calculate the upper bound of the valid range of values that can be achieved by the algorithm: `upperBound = a_i + (k^i - 1)`.

    *   Check if the current value in array `a` is within the valid range: `a_i <= v_i <= a_i + (k^i - 1)`. If not, set `canAchieve` to `False`.

    *   After checking all positions, return `YES` if `canAchieve` is still `True`, and `NO` otherwise.

Here's the Python code for the solution:","def canAchieveArray(v, k, a):

0096,auto_few_shot_cot,ERROR,Timeout on test 5,"To solve the problem, let's first understand how the function $f(x)$ works and how the $path(x)$ is constructed.

The function $f(x)$ is defined as follows:

- If $x$ is even, $f(x) = \frac{x}{2}$.
- If $x$ is odd, $f(x) = x - 1$.

The $path(x)$ is constructed by repeatedly applying the function $f(x)$ to the current value until we get $1$.

Now, let's think about how to find the maximum value $y$ that is contained in at least $k$ different lists $path(x)$.

We can observe that the values in the $path(x)$ are decreasing, and the number of steps required to reach $1$ from a value $x$ is $\log_2(x)$ when $x$ is a power of $2$, and $\frac{x+1}{2}$ otherwise.

Therefore, if we want to find the maximum value $y$ that is contained in at least $k$ different lists $path(x)$, we can start from the largest possible value of $y$ and check how many values of $x$ have $y$ in their $path(x)$.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:","import math

    res = []
    while x > 1:
        res.append(x)

**Problem 1: Cars on a Circular Track**

The problem states that there are $N$ cars on a circular track with length $N$. Each car has a certain amount of gasoline, and when a car passes another car, it steals all its gasoline. We need to find the total clockwise distance traveled by car $1$.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input: The first line contains a single integer $T$, which is the number of test cases. The next $T$ lines contain two integers each: $N$ and the amount of gasoline in each car.
2. Initialize variables: We need to keep track of the total distance traveled and the amount of gasoline left in each car.
3. Loop through each test case: For each test case, we need to simulate the movement of car $1$.
4. Move car $1$ and steal gasoline from other cars: We need to keep track of the amount of gasoline left in each car and move car $1$ accordingly.
5. Print the result: After simulating the movement of car $1$, we need to print the total distance traveled.

Here's the Python code:","for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    f = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sum1 = f[0]
    d = 0
    i = 1
    while sum1 != 0 and i < n:
        sum1 = sum1 - 1 + f[i]
        d += 1
        i += 1

### Problem 1: Tram Capacity

We are given a tram with `n` stops, and at each stop, `ai` passengers exit the tram and `bi` passengers enter it. The goal is to find the minimum capacity of the tram such that the number of passengers inside the tram never exceeds this capacity at any time.

The solution uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to calculate the cumulative sum of the difference between the entering and exiting passengers at each stop. The maximum of these cumulative sums is the minimum capacity required.","from itertools import accumulate
